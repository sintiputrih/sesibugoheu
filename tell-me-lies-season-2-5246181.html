Ever since the season finale aired, fans have been clamoring for news about season 2. It’s been quite the long wait, but the second season of the Hulu series is officially underway — and new cast members are getting all wrapped up in Lucy and Stephen’s world.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The series is based on the book of the same name by <strong>Carola Lovering</strong>. Lucy Albright and Stephen DeMarco’s tumultuous relationship and the drama they’ve caused have kept viewers riveted. This toxic entanglement is about to ramp up even more in season 2. <strong>Hollywood Life</strong> has gathered all the latest news about Tell Me Lies season 2.</p><h2>‘Tell Me Lies’ Season 2 Premiere Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Hulu hasn’t revealed the premiere date for Tell Me Lies season 2. Filming just got underway in January 2024. The official Tell Me Lies Instagram page shared photos of <strong>Grace Van Patten</strong>, <strong>Catherine Missal</strong>, and <strong>Sonia Mena</strong> back on set. Given the time frame, Tell Me Lies season 2 could premiere later in 2024 or early 2025.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-5></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by Tell Me Lies (@tellmelieshulu)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6></p><h2>‘Tell Me Lies’ Season 2 Cast?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>All of your Tell Me Lies faves will be back.<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Grace Van Patten</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jackson White</strong></a> are returning as Lucy and Stephen. Soon after the first season ended, Grace and Jackson confirmed their real-life relationship. In between the seasons, Grace and Jackson have been very <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public about their relationship</a> and attended various events together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tell-me-lies-season-2-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Additional cast members who are expected to be back include <strong>Catherine Missal</strong> as Bree, <strong>Spencer House</strong> as Wrigley, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sonia Mena</strong></a> as Pippa, <strong>Branden Cook</strong> as Evan, <strong>Benjamin Wadsworth </strong>as Drew, and <strong>Alicia Crowder</strong> as Diana.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Gossip Girl alum <strong>Thomas Doherty</strong> has joined the cast in a recurring role. He’ll play Leo, a junior at Baird who returns to campus after studying abroad for a year and finds himself immediately drawn to Lucy. He is seemingly as kind as he is charming, but Lucy isn’t sure whether she can fully trust him. Leo will eventually become entangled in the web created by Lucy and Stephen’s toxic relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thomas-doherty-tell-me-lies.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Lucifer star <strong>Tom Ellis</strong> has joined the season 2 cast as a series regular. According to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>, Tom will play Oliver, a “professor at Baird College whose tough love attitude makes him an intimidating presence that isn’t appreciated by all students. He is married to Lucy’s professor Marianne, but as one of the main characters begins seeking his approval, his influence will have chaotic repercussions.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tom is married to Tell Me Lies showrunner <strong>Meaghan Oppenheimer</strong>. He’s also teaming up with his wife and Tell Me Lies executive producer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a> on another Hulu show called Second Wife. Tom and Emma will star in and executive produce the series. Meaghan created the series and will serve as the showrunner.</p><h2>What Happened at the End of ‘Tell Me Lies’ Season 1?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Tell Me Lies season 1 ended with a number of cliffhangers. At the end of the 2008 school year, Lucy and Stephen’s relationship is hanging by a thread. Macy’s death has cast a huge cloud over everyone. Stephen and Diana have a chat at an end-of-year party, and she invites him to work at her dad’s firm in New York City for the summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tell-me-lies-season-2-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>After being humiliated by Lucy earlier in the season, Diana gets the last laugh. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stephen and Diana get back together</a> and parade their reunion in front of Lucy at the party. Lucy finds comfort in Evan, Bree’s boyfriend, and she wakes up in bed with him the next morning.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The show flashes forward to Evan and Bree’s engagement party in 2015. Evan drops a hint that Drew may have died in the aftermath of Macy’s death. Lucy crosses paths with Stephen at the party, and viewers learn that Stephen is engaged to Lucy’s best friend Lydia.</p><h2>What Will Happen in ‘Tell Me Lies’ Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>Hollywood Life</strong> spoke exclusively with the Tell Me Lies showrunner about the game-changing finale and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>what’s to come in season 2</a>. She revealed that Bree does “not” know about Lucy and Evan sleeping together all those years ago, so that hookup could come back to haunt them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tell-me-lies-season-2-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Meaghan also teased that season 2 will feature a “much more vulnerable Lucy. I think she’s been drinking the Kool-Aid and has been under this spell of having Stephen beside her and feeling kind of powerful. I think a lot of her own mistakes will be very clear to her at the beginning of season 2 of how much she has hurt people that actually were good to her. I think we will be finding probably a kinder, softer Lucy because I think she’s a kind person. She has walls up, and she’s a mess sometimes, but I don’t think she’s inherently cruel. I think she became cruel because of Stephen.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The EP noted that season 2 would likely “explore some of Stephen and Lucy’s romantic lives away from each other, or at least part of the time. They wouldn’t be together at the beginning of the season. I think it would be really interesting to see a new love interest come in for Lucy that was messed up and complicated in very different ways and see her try to unlearn some of the behavior that she learned from Stephen and probably fail to unlearn those things. But I do think there will be some rage there, and there will absolutely be some revenge plots that happen at some point.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Oeo6VlnZp6rbXErGSsnZGovK95kWZsa2xmZoVyew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftell-me-lies-season-2-5246181.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftell-me-lies-season-2-5246181.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftell-me-lies-season-2-5246181.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftell-me-lies-season-2-5246181.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftell-me-lies-season-2-5246181.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftell-me-lies-season-2-5246181.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cinemacon-comes-and-goes-with-no-mention-of-a-pulled-stephen-king-horror-that-showed-a-full-trailer-last-year.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cinemacon-comes-and-goes-with-no-mention-of-a-pulled-stephen-king-horror-that-showed-a-full-trailer-last-year.html>CinemaCon comes and goes with no mention of a pulled Stephen King horror that showed a full trailer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jennifer-lopez-body-criticism-netflix-documentary.html>Jennifer Lopez Admits It Was Hard Dealing With Body Criticism In The Media: I Was A Joke</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jennifer-lopez-body-criticism-netflix-documentary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
