the life of its lead actor, Channing Tatum, who played the role of Mike.</p><p>Back when Tatum was eighteen before he became a star, he worked as a stripper to make a living.</p><p>He went by the name of Chan Crawford and performed at a local nightclub in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>Mike later confessed that he wasn’t particularly proud of it, but he wasn’t ashamed of it either.</p><p>He wanted to make a movie about his experiences as a stripper and share the energy and atmosphere of that world.</p><p>However, except for some superficial details from his life, the story is mainly fictional.</p><p>He clarified that the movie is based on the world that he had once been a part of, but there is \”not one character that I took from my real life\”.</p><h2><span id=How_old_is_Channing_Tatum_now>How old
