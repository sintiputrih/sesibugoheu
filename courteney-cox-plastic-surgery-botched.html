While she has been open about receiving anti-aging fillers to stop aging, she also admits that she regrets her decision now.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a> is an American <a href=#><strong>actress</strong></a> and filmmaker best known as Monica Geller in the NBC sitcom, Friends. She was also recognized for her role as Gale Weathers in the horror film franchise, Scream, and&nbsp;Jules Cobb in the ABC/TBS sitcom, Cougar Town, which even earned her nominations at the Golden Globe Awards and the Critics' Choice Awards.</p><p>However, Courteney Cox has received a lot of criticism throughout her career for her unnatural appearance. Many people blamed her drastic change in appearance on botched plastic surgery. So, if you're wondering which cosmetic procedures she really underwent, we're here to help.</p><p>Have a look at the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Julianna Margulies</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Seth MacFarlane</strong></a>.</p><h2>Courteney Cox Botched Plastic Surgery: She Previously Revealed Her Biggest Beauty Regret Was Getting Facial Fillers!</h2><p>If you have ever watched Friends, you might know how <strong>Courteney Cox</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@courteneycoxofficial</a>) used to be. However, she has now changed completely which is the result of her botched plastic surgery. She is one of the few women in Hollywood who has been open about the cosmetic procedures she has had on her face.</p><p>The 57-year-old actress has admitted to a massive amount of work, admitting that she, too, thought she had gone too far at one point, appearing completely unrecognizable. When comparing photos of the actress from the 1990s to now, it's clear she's undergone a variety of procedures.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/12/courteney-cox-plastic-surgery-botched-now.jpg alt="Courteney Cox appearance after botched plastic surgery. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Courteney Cox appearance after botched plastic surgery.<br>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>However, the Friends alum previously revealed why she regrets getting facial <strong>fillers</strong> in the past and how she felt pressured to look younger to meet society's standards talking to the Gloss Angeles podcast. She <a href=# rel=noopener>stated,</a></p><p><strong>Thinking I was getting older when I was really young, that's just a bummer, a waste of ti. meIt's a domino effect, it's like you don't realize that you look a little off, so then you keep doing more 'cause you look normal to yourself. You look in the mirror and go, 'Oh, that looks good,' and you don't realize what it looks like to the outside.</strong></p><p>The Scream actress even admitted to hosts <strong>Kirbie Johnson</strong> and <strong>Sara Tan Christensen</strong> that she had too many fillers injected. At that moment she expressed,</p><p><strong>Thank god they are removable. I think I messed up a lot and now, luckily, I was able to reverse most of that. Now, I'm actually just older." Later, the 59-year-old went on to say that fillers were her biggest beauty regret, saying,&nbsp; "I look at pictures of me from when I thought I looked okay, and I can't believe it.</strong></p><p>However, this isn't the first time Courteney Cox has spoken out about fillers or other past beauty treatments; she previously revealed in the interview which was published in the Sunday Times of the United Kingdom on February 20, 2022, that she attempted to achieve youthfulness by undergoing plastic surgery procedures. She <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>,</p><p><strong>I didn't realize that, oh s--t, I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now. There was a period where I went, 'I've got to stop. That's just crazy.'</strong></p><p>Furthermore, she noted that she gained a new sense of confidence back in 2017 after getting her fillers dissolved. Later, she shared with NewBeauty, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>, "I feel better because I look like myself. I think that I now look more like the person that I was.
