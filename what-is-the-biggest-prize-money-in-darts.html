In this article, we will explore the evolution of prize money in darts and discuss the biggest prizes in the sport's history.</p><h2>The Evolution of Darts Prize Money</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Darts has transitioned from being a recreational game to a professional sport, with major tournaments being organized worldwide. As the popularity of the sport grew, so did the financial rewards for the players. In the early days, prize money in darts was relatively modest, with winners receiving a nominal sum. However, as television coverage and sponsorship deals increased, the prize pools began to grow substantially.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Influence of Television</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the significant factors that contributed to the rise in darts prize money was the advent of televised tournaments. The decision to broadcast darts tournaments on television proved to be a game-changer for the sport. Television coverage brought darts into people's living rooms, attracting larger audiences and generating more interest.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The increased viewership led to the involvement of sponsors, who saw the potential for brand exposure. With sponsors on board, the prize money for darts tournaments saw a significant boost. As the sport's popularity continued to rise, the financial rewards for the players became more substantial.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Pioneering Tournaments</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The first darts tournament to offer a substantial cash prize was the News of the World Darts Championship, established in 1927. The tournament continued until 1990 and was considered the pinnacle of darts at the time. The prize money for this tournament gradually increased over the years, eventually reaching £100,000 in its final edition.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the 1970s, the British Darts Organization (BDO) World Championship emerged as another prestigious tournament in the darts calendar. The BDO World Championship offered a significant prize pool, attracting top players from around the world. The prize money for this tournament continued to increase steadily, peaking at £100,000 in 1993.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Modern Era: The PDC and the World Championship</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the early 1990s, a significant split occurred in the darts world, leading to the formation of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). The PDC introduced a new era of darts, with bigger tournaments and even more significant prize money. The PDC World Championship became the flagship tournament, offering substantial rewards for the players.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Since its inception, the PDC World Championship has continued to break records in terms of prize money. The tournament's prize pool has seen a meteoric rise, with the winner's share increasing year after year. The 2020 edition of the PDC World Championship had a staggering prize pool of £2.5 million, with the winner receiving £500,000.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Premier League Darts</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Premier League Darts, another prestigious tournament organized by the PDC, also boasts a substantial prize fund. The tournament features a select group of top players competing in a round-robin format over several weeks. The winner of the Premier League Darts receives a handsome prize, with the 2020 champion taking home £250,000.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>World Series of Darts Finals</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The World Series of Darts Finals is another tournament that has seen a significant increase in prize money in recent years. This tournament features top players from around the world and offers a substantial prize pool. The 2019 edition of the World Series of Darts Finals had a prize fund of £500,000, with the winner receiving £100,000.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Darts has come a long way since its early days as a pub game, with prize money in the sport reaching unprecedented heights. The influence of television coverage and sponsorship deals has played a significant role in the growth of prize money in darts tournaments.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The evolution of prize money in darts can be traced from the pioneering tournaments like the News of the World Darts Championship and the BDO World Championship to the modern era of the PDC and its flagship events like the PDC World Championship and the Premier League Darts.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As the popularity of darts continues to grow, it is likely that we will witness even bigger prize money in the future. The financial rewards for the players have transformed darts into a highly competitive and lucrative sport, attracting top talent from around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSboZecsrTAjKmporKVYrqwusSyZKKmXZmus8DS</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-biggest-prize-money-in-darts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-the-biggest-prize-money-in-darts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-biggest-prize-money-in-darts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-the-biggest-prize-money-in-darts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-biggest-prize-money-in-darts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-biggest-prize-money-in-darts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-johnny-cueto-wife-everything-to-know-about-the-wife-of-baseball-pitcher-of-san-francisco-giants.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-johnny-cueto-wife-everything-to-know-about-the-wife-of-baseball-pitcher-of-san-francisco-giants.html>Who Is Johnny Cueto Wife?
