Better known by the&nbsp; stage name of Steve-O, he is an American television and radio personality, comedian, stunt performer, actor, as well as a screenwriter. To the public, Steve-O is perhaps best known as a member of “Jackass”, a group of people who film themselves performing dangerous and self-injuring pranks, as well as stunts.</p><p>A well-known television personality and a member of “Jackass” prank group, just how rich is Steve-O, as of late 2017? According to sources, Steve-O’s net worth is estimated to be $4 million, mostly coming from his involvement in the entertainment industry which began in the late 1990s.</p><h3>Steve-O Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>During his childhood, Steve-O travelled a lot with his parents as his father was an executive with Pepsi-Cola, and lived in Uganda, Venezuela and Canada for a couple of years, before returning back to London. Steve-O studied at the American School of London and then continued his studies in several universities in the US before finally graduating from Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey Clown College in 1997.</p><p>Steve-O then started working as a clown, and at the same time began filming various stunts. Eventually, he was noticed by <a href=#>Jeff Tremaine</a>, a director of “Jackass”, who invited him to join the group. Steve-O joined <a href=#>Johnny Knoxville</a>, <a href=#>Bam Margera</a>, <a href=#>Ryan Dunn</a> and <a href=#>Chris Pontius</a> in 2000, when the group launched its own reality series on MTV network. Since its debut on television screens, “Jackass” became a huge hit, and even though it met with a lot of controversy, it is still considered to be one of the most successful prank series ever created.</p><p>When “Jackass” finished its run on MTV in 2002, Steve-O together with Pontius went on to star in their own series called “Wildboyz”. In addition to that Steve-O made an appearance on <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>’s “The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show”, “Love Island”, and “The Dean Blundell Show”. The popularity of “Jackass” show resulted in the creation of several “Jackass” movies, including “Jackass: The Movie” that grossed over $89 million worldwide, “Jackass: Number Two” and “Jackass 3-D”, which made more than $170 million in the box office. Steve-O’s net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>In addition to movies, “Jackass: The Game” was released in 2007 by Sidhe Interactive, a game developer based in New Zealand. Over the years, “Jackass” has become a worldwide phenomenon that inspired such shows as “Dirty Sanchez”, “Nitro Circus”, “Crazy Monkey”, and “Rad Girls”, to name a few.</p><p>Steve-O’s career came to a sudden halt when in 2008 he experienced mental issues. When he admitted to suffering from suicidal thoughts and bipolar disorder, Steve-O was placed in a psychiatric hold and underwent medical treatment. Even though Steve-O relapsed several times, he was able to control his depressive state, and managed to return to the entertainment industry with “Jackass 3-D”, his autobiography called “Professional Idiot: A Memoir”, and two of his own YouTube channels.</p><p>As if to finally demonstrate his complete recovery, in 2014 Steve-O was charged with misconduct when he did a backflip into the San Antonio River from a bridge, was a competitor in the second series of British TV show “The Jump”, and then in 2015 climbed a construction crane in Los Angeles in a protest against SeaWorld. He apparently demanded jail time, partly for publicity.</p><p>In his personal life, Steve-O was married to Candy-Jane Tucker from 2002 to 2003, and to Brittany McGraw from 2006 to 2008, since when he has reputedly been single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=31.494256756757><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Steve-O</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$2.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 13, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 9 in (1.77 m)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Profession</td><td>Stunt Performer, Actor, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Rapper, Presenter, Comedian, TV Personality, Radio personality</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>American School in London in St. John's Wood, University of Miami, University of New Mexico, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Candy-Jane Tucker (m. 2002–2003), Brittany McGraw (m. 2006–2008)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Donna Gay, Ted Glover</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Cindy Glover</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nicknames</td><td>Stephen Gilchrist Glover , Steve Glover , Squirt , Stephen Glover , Steven Glover , Steve 'Steve-O' Glover , Steve O</td></tr><tr readability=0.42105263157895><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/SteveO</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38888888888889><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/steveo</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/officiallysteveo</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/steveoarmy</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0828177</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>West Coast Madness, Universal</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Albums</td><td>The Dumbest Asshole in Hip Hop (2008)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Movie Award for Best Jaw Dropping Moment, MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>“Jackass 3-D” (2010), “Jackass: The Movie” (2002), ”Jackass: Number Two” (2006), ”Jackass 3.5” (2011)</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Jackass” (2000-2002), “Dirty Sanchez”, “Killer Karaoke” (2012-2013), “Nitro Circus” (2009), “Crazy Monkey”, “Wildboyz” (2003-2006), “Rad Girls”, “The Jump” (2015), “The Howard Stern Show”, “Love Island”, “The Dean Blundell Show”</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=3><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Catchphase: "Yeah, dude!"</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Raspy voice</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Often vomits in Jackass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Leopard skin thong</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Strange, bizzare tattoos</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>6</td><td>His dangerous, controversial stunts</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=114><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=9><td>1</td><td>I skew quite blue. A lot of my stuff is really, really pretty filthy and raunchy, which I don't think would be much of surprise. And I include some physicality as well. I suppose it's an exercise of being faithful to my brand, but I do enjoy doing physical stunts and tricks, and I always incorporate them into the show as well.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>2</td><td>When I was a kid, I loved a heavy metal band called Motley Crue. I was thirteen when they came to my city, and I called every hotel in the Yellow Pages asking for a room by the name of their manager in hopes of meeting the band. After two or three hours of calling hotels, I got through, and the manager's brother answered the phone.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>3</td><td>When I was fifteen years old, my dad won a video camera in a corporate golf tournament. I snatched it from his closet and began filming skateboard videos with my friends.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>4</td><td>When I first became involved with PETA, it was on an 'issue-by-issue' basis - they interviewed me in my old apartment about animal abuse in the circus as I sat on a leather sofa.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>5</td><td>What brings you closer to God is being in service to others. I think any religion or spiritual way of life will indicate that service to others will lead to a connection with a higher power.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>6</td><td>When I first became recognizable from appearing on television, I abused my notoriety as much as I possibly could, at the expense of both my health and personal relationships.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>7</td><td>The first thought that I had about really trying to get sober was, 'Man, I could do a lot of good in the world. I can lead by example and just be this heroic recovery guy.' And that's just a bad reason to get sober. You can't get sober for anybody's benefit, let alone the world at large. You really got to do it for yourself.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>8</td><td>The idea is to improve somebody's day. That's how I've always viewed my job. I'm a distraction therapist. I make people's problems go away for just a little bit.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>9</td><td>There's definitely some parallels between me and Joaquin Phoenix, I think. The line gets so blurry. My rap career wasn't a hoax, but it was absolutely intended to be a joke. The problem was that I really was on a quest to somehow be a Caucasian Ol' Dirty Bastard.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>10</td><td>Rather than wait to be discovered, discover yourself. Whatever it is that you intend to do later, start doing it now, get good at it, and show people what you've done. Actions speak louder than words.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>11</td><td>My first call is always to my dad. It's really rad. What had initially drove my dad and me apart - all my stunts and antics - has brought us together, closer than we've ever been. My dad's been a huge part of my team.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>12</td><td>I never contemplated any kind of existence or identity after my career. I never thought at some point the entertainment industry is going to be through with me. And when it first occurred to me that my career was going to cease to be ascendant, then I freaked out.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>13</td><td>I started out making skateboard videos. Soon, it dawned on me I just wasn't that great at skateboarding. So I put down the skateboard and just kept going with the camera.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>14</td><td>I wouldn't have really committed myself to any kind of spiritual lifestyle, I don't think, if I had not endured great suffering. I think that's the case with a lot of people.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>15</td><td>Initially, my decision to stop eating meat was motivated by fear of spiritual consequences, but right away I found that not eating meat made me feel good about myself. It increased my self-esteem, which I found so rewarding, I wanted to do more.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>16</td><td>It's commonly said that if slaughterhouses had clear glass walls, nobody would eat meat. I think people go out of their way to remain ignorant about how factory farm animals are treated.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>17</td><td>I felt like it was inevitable that I was going to fail in life and die young. So I was frantically scrambling to document my stunts and pack my message into a bottle. I thought maybe I could be discovered after I'd died, like Van Gogh.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>18</td><td>I got into being vegan because I was simply looking to benefit from being more compassionate. I have since come to learn that it is an animal-based diet that is responsible for the overwhelming majority of cases of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, and all kinds of other problems.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>19</td><td>I guess I just always imagined that I was going to die, like, somehow on top. I was going to, like, go out in some sort of blaze of glory. I never thought about sort of fading into obscurity. And I've worked so hard at having a life, an identity, in obscurity and finding peace with that.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>20</td><td>I have a tough stomach, and I've put myself through a lot. But when I first found out what happens to animals on modern factory farms and in today's slaughterhouses, I wanted to throw up - I literally couldn't believe it.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>21</td><td>I have been really enjoying making a project out of seeking out an extremely healthy diet of raw, organic, vegan foods - and I plan on continuing to do so.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>22</td><td>For me to make a living acting silly for as long as I can get away with it, I think the most viable way to make that happen is to evolve into more traditional comedy. I've really been putting in the work.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>23</td><td>I came to San Antonio, and it's known for the River Walk. So I was just doing some sightseeing, I looked at the bridge and I thought, 'Man, if I do a flip off this bridge, that would be super-cool.' I don't recommend anybody jump off that bridge.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>24</td><td>I don't go around lecturing people and telling them they shouldn't eat meat. I just don't think that's terribly effective. I just try to tell people how I have personally benefitted from the vegan lifestyle.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>25</td><td>Anybody that's not supportive of me staying sober obviously has to go. But on the other hand, there are not really a lot of people who don't want me to stay sober. I was a nightmare.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>26</td><td>At this point, I've really failed at a lot of things. It's nice to be able to say that, in a way. I've failed at music. I've failed at dance. And acting - there have been times when I went out and read lines to audition for acting parts. I believe that if anybody wrangled together those audition tapes, it would be pretty hysterically funny.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>27</td><td>I'm definitely a ham for the paparazzi.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>28</td><td>I'm the perfect kind of personality for making YouTube videos. I deal in short attention span theater. I do wild things.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>29</td><td>The psychiatric ward was a really creepy place and, hindsight being 20/20, the creepiest thing about it was that I truly belonged there.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>30</td><td>There really is no ethical difference between eating a cat or a chicken, a dog or a pig.</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>31</td><td>Almost as soon as I went vegan, people started telling me that my skin looked great, and that I appeared younger, slimmer, and healthier. I'm convinced that of all the changes I've made to my lifestyle, it's the adoption of a vegan diet that has been best for me - physically, mentally, and certainly spiritually.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>32</td><td>I'm a proud vegan, whistle-blower, and animal rights activist.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>33</td><td>I think people will be surprised to find that I'm not as much of an idiot as they think I am. I'm not a real moron.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>34</td><td>I think it's important for me to show the world that sobriety hasn't made me soft. I'm on a mission to prove I'm still a nutcase.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>35</td><td>I keep my iPod on shuffle most of the time, but I'm most into Cirque du Soleil soundtracks.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>36</td><td>I have a rescue dog named Walter, and Walter and I are such fans of the 'Jersey Shore' that we changed his name to DJ Wally D.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>37</td><td>I don't think I'm a gay icon. I have no axe to grind. I mean, I'm clearly not homophobic! I'm not pro or con.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>38</td><td>Being a vegan just helps me build up my self-esteem. I feel good about it every time I eat a meal.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>39</td><td>I don't care if people think I'm boring.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>40</td><td>Abuse yourself all you want - just leave animals out of it. Don't wear fur.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>41</td><td>My main focus in sobriety has been to replace fear with faith or love.</td></tr><tr readability=18><td>42</td><td>[on quitting drinking] The whole last year before I got sober, I really became a nasty, mean-spirited guy. I think I felt so bad about myself that I took it out on everybody else. I put together this mass e-mail list with the most influential people in my life, and I would blast everyone all these ridiculous e-mails, thinking that it was all, like, really cool at the time...Like, I would describe hallucinations I was having. Or I would talk about jacking off. And I was copying my own family on all this crazy bullshit. And I would just attack people for the benefit of this list of 100 different people. It was all really embarrassing, man. I thought some really inappropriate shit was okay. And that's the scariest thing, to think that if I pick up a drink or a drug, I'll go back to that place...I would love to be able to smoke pot. But the problem is if I do that, my weed bone's connected to my booze bone. And my booze bone's connected to my coke bone. And then it's all this crazy shit. I used to try to quit piecemeal and ultimately I always wound up going back to everything. So the only thing I'm sure of is that if I do choose to drink or get high again, it's all bad -- Not even downhill. You pick up where you left off. And where I left off was a really bad place, man.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=48.655708390646><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>He has his own YouTube channel.</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>2</td><td>His father was American, with English, Northern Irish, and Scottish ancestry, and his mother was Canadian, with French-Canadian roots.
