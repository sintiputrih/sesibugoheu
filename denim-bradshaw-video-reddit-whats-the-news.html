<time>08 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A teenager died because of an arrest of the heart after his body was apparently to be thrown by a bull during the North Carolina rodeo.</p><p>The victim, identified by his family members as Denim Bradshaw (14 years old) reported to have fallen from the animal during the event prior to being crushed by it.</p><p>Emergency Medical Services (EMS) located in Stokes County were alerted to reports of a <a href=# rel=noopener>cardiac arrest</a> during an Rafter K Rodeo Company LLC, event held in King at around 8.24 p.m. on the night of 28 January.</p><p>Despite two EMTs taking life-saving steps on the scene the teenager was transported by ambulance to the nearby hospital, where it was later determined that he had died according to&nbsp;The Fox&nbsp;8.</p><p>A <a href=# rel=noopener>picture shared on social media</a> shows a number of people kneeling at the rodeo as a gesture of respect following the incident. Bradshaw suffered a cardiac arrest.</p><p>The mother of Bradshaw Shannon Bowman <a href=# rel=noopener>paid tribute</a> to her son through her&nbsp;facebook&nbsp;post after his death.</p><p>She told me: “Last <a href=# rel=noopener>night was the longest</a> night of my life! My gorgeous handsome 14-year-old <a href=# rel=noopener>son went into heaven to meet</a> Jesus the Lord. The next morning, I was to nightmares for the remainder all my days.</p><p>“I am so sorry for this call , but the man was enjoying <a href=# rel=noopener>every minute</a> of it. I’ve never seen him as happy like I saw the <a href=# rel=noopener>last night</a> prior to his departure.</p><p>“Denim baby you did it. You did that. <a href=# rel=noopener>I’m so proud</a> of your braveness and your courage. My lil cowboy, I will love and miss you so much and I <a href=# rel=noopener>know God</a> will take care of you.”</p><p>Bowman demanded for on-site EMTs during rodeo events.</p><p>Bradshaw’s uncle, Shaun Rennie Shaun Renn, wrote in a post on his Facebook page the following day: “Well my <a href=# rel=noopener>mother just called and my little nephew then I wanted to go for the bull riding contest and he fell off and then the bull came and crushed him and he just passed away rest in peace denim Bradshaw I’m so sorry it happened</a> to you you’re too young.”</p><p>An official from Rafter K Rodeo LLC, <a href=# rel=noopener>said in a post posted to Facebook</a> this Sunday, that they had EMTs in attendance at the event “Everyone in the vicinity of Rafter K Rodeo LLC, would like to express our condolences sincere for the loved ones and family of bull rider Denim Bradshaw.</p><p>“Our <a href=# rel=noopener>game is actually a community</a> and we are grateful to all those who came to assist. We are grateful for our paramedics, EMTs and EMTs who are on-site and <a href=# rel=noopener>law enforcement officers</a> who do their best to provide care for the cowboys.</p><p>“This is a tragic event and words cannot describe the pain felt by this loss. We ask everyone to <a href=# rel=noopener>come together</a> and pray for his family for comfort and healing in this difficult time.”</p><p>A number of other organizations <a href=# rel=noopener>pay the tribute of Bradshaw and expressed their sympathy to the family</a> of his.</p><p>Sauratown Trailblazers Horse Club said: Sauratown Trailblazers Horse Club said: “The Sauratown Trailblazers send their condolences and prayers to the <a href=# rel=noopener>family and family members</a> of Denim Bradshaw, a 14-year-old bull rider who died in the rodeo last night in King.</p><p>“We also are <a href=# rel=noopener>thinking of the people</a> who were there and saw it, along with the first responders who did their best to help.”</p><h3>Rodeo Injuries</h3><p>A study from June 2022 published by the&nbsp;Kansas Journal of Medicine&nbsp;declared that the identification of 70 <a href=# rel=noopener>people who were injured</a> in rodeos over the course of a decade.</p><p>The report added: “Half were injured by <a href=# rel=noopener>direct contact</a> with rodeo stock and 34 by falls. <a href=# rel=noopener>Head injuries</a> were most common, occurring in 38 (54.3 percent). Twenty injuries (28.6 percent) required surgery. Sixty-nine patients (98.6 percent) were discharged home. There was one death.”</p><p>The study also discovered that head <a href=# rel=noopener>injuries that are serious</a> occur in rodeo participants at an average of 15 % per 11,000 rides.&nbsp;The study revealed that football players are prone to <a href=# rel=noopener>serious head injuries</a> at an average that is 5.8 to every 100 players.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>GoFundMe fundraising campaign was set up on behalf of the family</a> of Bradshaw after his passing.</p><p>The campaign was arranged by Bradshaw’s sister, Persephone Bowman, said: “He got to <a href=# rel=noopener>ride his first bull</a> on the 28th of January and the excitement was palpable. No one could imagine that the first <a href=# rel=noopener>time he rode could result</a> in his death, and we’re beyond sad. Our precious 14-year-old <a href=# rel=noopener>son passed away during what was probably the most thrilling time</a> of his life and we’re grieving the loss of him.</p><p>“Denim always had a sparkle in his eye and a smile on his face lighting up every room he walked into. He had dreams of becoming an officer with his dog Aphora. To know Denim was to love him.”</p><p>Since it was launched on Sunday the <a href=# rel=noopener>GoFundMe campaign</a> collected more than $5,000 of a $15,000 target.</p><p>Bradshaw remains with his mom, Shannon Bowman, his <a href=# rel=noopener>father Billy and his siblings:</a> Braxton Knight Triston Knight Persephone Bowman as well as Daylin Scott.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGibnqaZonqjvsCdqqGZp2LDqrDEqGSrnZSZtrV51qGYratdqbWmec2erqxn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdenim-bradshaw-video-reddit-whats-the-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdenim-bradshaw-video-reddit-whats-the-news.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdenim-bradshaw-video-reddit-whats-the-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdenim-bradshaw-video-reddit-whats-the-news.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdenim-bradshaw-video-reddit-whats-the-news.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdenim-bradshaw-video-reddit-whats-the-news.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./omarion-hampton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./omarion-hampton.html>Omarion Hampton | Fan Arch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./david-freiburger-net-worth-2024.html>David Freiburger Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./david-freiburger-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
