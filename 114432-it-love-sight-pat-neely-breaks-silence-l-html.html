He revealed during an exclusive interview with <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/pat-neely-speaks-out-divorce-gina-neely/>People Magazine</a> that he never agreed to any interviews about his separation since he never knew how to explain it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/403a45be186fd9c72a9c43377ebca9dc11038651540483032.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>“At the time, I was hurting. I was devastated. And I didn’t have the words to explain it. It was a challenging time, but it’s a chapter that has long passed me.”</p><p class=Fg>Pat and Gina were together for more than two decades, and he reveals that it was his ex-wife that wanted a divorce. Last March, the former Mrs. Neely revealed that although they seemed to be happy, bubbly, and affectionate in their TV show, it wasn't like that at all in real life.</p><p class=Fg>While their relationship had to end, Pat chooses to focus on their better memories, including filming 11 seasons of one of the most top-rated shows at one point.</p><p class=Fg>“One of the things that I’ll always cherish about Down Home with the Neelys was that I had an opportunity to get on television every day and invite people into our home. And I was able to share that with my high school sweetheart, a woman I truly loved, and to be me. I never had to act.”</p><p class=Fg>Although his wish of growing old with Gina didn't happen, he accepted Gina's request to separate. The couple shared two children, Shelbi, 23, and Spenser, 29.</p><p class=Fg>Now, Neely has since moved on and is married to Tamika Parks and he claims it was "love at first sight".</p><p class=Fg>The two co-parent Tamika's 5-year-old son from another relationship, and their daughter, Eriel, 3 months.</p><p class=Fg>While he kept his relationship under wraps in the past few years, he is now ready to share his beautiful family to the world, especially since he is set to head back to work next year as a culinary consultant for an Atlanta-based franchise called "This Is It! BBQ & Seafood".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpobWxjZ3qqwIylpq%2BdXai2qLTTZqearF2jsqa42GaZq52RoMBuv8ilnKeblWK5b7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f114432-it-love-sight-pat-neely-breaks-silence-l-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f114432-it-love-sight-pat-neely-breaks-silence-l-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f114432-it-love-sight-pat-neely-breaks-silence-l-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f114432-it-love-sight-pat-neely-breaks-silence-l-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f114432-it-love-sight-pat-neely-breaks-silence-l-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f114432-it-love-sight-pat-neely-breaks-silence-l-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./khloe-kardashians-candid-dating-quotes-after-tristan-thompson-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./khloe-kardashians-candid-dating-quotes-after-tristan-thompson-split.html>Khloe Kardashian's Candid Dating Quotes After Tristan Thompson Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./david-blaine-suffered-injury-by-shooting-himself-html.html>David Blaines Attempt to Shoot Himself in the Mouth Went Awry, Making You Wonder If You Even Unde</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./david-blaine-suffered-injury-by-shooting-himself-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
