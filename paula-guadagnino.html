And if you decided on Vinny Guadagnino, you are right. If you didn't know, then let us tell you Paula is Vinny's mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Paula is an Italian lady who is from Sicily, Italy. The charming lady has been seen multiple times on <i>Jersey Shore</i> with Vinny & the gang. As Vinny's mama, she used to come in to cook for him and does the laundry. But all that is perfectly normal for Vinny is a family-oriented guy who lives with his family.</p><h2>Net Worth: How Rich Is Paula's Son Vinny Guadagnino?</h2><p>Paula Guadagnino's son Vinny is one of the richest reality TV stars out there. He did buy the family a house in Staten Island in 2012.

He also released a cookbook named <i>The Keto Guido Cookbook: Delicious Recipes to Get Healthy and Look Great</i>.</p><h2>How Was The Married Life Of &nbsp;Paula?</h2><p>Paula Giacomo got married relatively young to Mr. Guadagnino, a fellow Italian-origin man. The pair tried hard to pursue a better life for their three kids and lived in poor situations.</p><p>Sadly, her husband turned out to be an absent father. This is reported to be one of the reasons they separated. While the couple lives in the same house, they live on different floors. Reportedly, they are still legally married and do not choose to divorce due to religious reasons.</p><p>Paula's husband has been very private and has not made any appearances on his son Vinny's reality TV projects or on Instagram. In interviews, Vinny Guadagnino stated that his father, while living in the same house, was never interested in doing projects together.</p><h2>About Paula's Brother, Uncle Nino</h2><p>Uncle Nino was also a recurring member of <i>Jersey Shore</i>.
