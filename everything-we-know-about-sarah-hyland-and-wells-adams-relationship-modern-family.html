Sarah made it no secret that she had a crush on her future fiance, tweeting: "Ugh! @WellsAdams making a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lord of the Flies</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> reference on men tell all??? #knewhewasthebestfromthestart #menwhoreadarehot.”</span></p><h2 id=they-flirted-on-social-media><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>They Flirted On Social Media</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2017, things started to heat up on social media between the two</a> when Sarah tweeted her excitement to see Wells on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bachelor in Paradise</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as the bartender. She tweeted: “OH MY GOD @WellsAdams IS THE FRIKKIN BARTENDER?! Best. Season.

He said: “Next time I’m in LA, I’m taking you out for drinks and tacos.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-by-her-side-during-her-kidney-transplants><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Was By Her Side During Her Kidney Transplants</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In September 2017, Sarah had to have a second kidney transplant. It was also around the same time that Sarah met Wells in person. Three days before her surgery, the two met, and they were both smitten from the start. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wells stood by Sarah’s side before, during, and after her transplant</a>, despite the fact that they weren’t officially dating yet, and barely knew each other.</span></p><h2 id=rumors-began-swirling-when-they-posted-a-couples-costume-on-halloween><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Rumors Began Swirling When They Posted A Couples Costume On Halloween</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>About a month later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two started to spark rumors that something was truly going on </a>between them. Sarah posted a picture of them in their Halloween costume to her Instagram. They went as a couples costume, Sarah dressing as Dustin and Wells dressing as Eleven from the hit Netflix show, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Stranger Things</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h2 id=it-was-reported-they-were-dating-in-november-of-2017><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>It Was Reported They Were Dating In November Of 2017</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>After that Halloween photo, and posting a few flirty photos in between, the rumor mill really started swirling.

Although Wells was away for work, he made sure that he was still there for Sarah by any means possible, and tried to make it back home to her as fast as he could.</span></p><h2 id=they-did-long-distance-for-a-while><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Did Long Distance For A While</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately for the couple, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were forced to&nbsp;do long-distance for a little while</a> during their relationship. Of course, Sarah lived in LA since she was taping episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Modern Family</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, however, Wells lived in Nashville at the time.

Why is that? They both fall on completely opposite sides of the political spectrum.
