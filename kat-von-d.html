Her journey into the world of tattoos began when she got her first tattoo at the age of 14. She decided to leave school at the age of 16 to pursue her dream of becoming a tattoo artist. At the age of 15, Kat Von D spent six months at Provo Canyon School, where she alleges she suffered abuse. Notably, this is the same boarding school that Paris Hilton attended, and Hilton has also claimed to have been abused during her time there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kat-1600x1066-1-1024x682.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Career_of_Kat_Von_D></span><strong>The Career of Kat Von D</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kat Von D decided to take a different path and dropped out of school a few years after getting her first tattoo.

During her time in the industry, she worked alongside tattoo artists like Clay Decker, Chris Garver, and Tim Hendricks.

Oliver Peck, her husband at the time, later broke this record by completing 415 tattoos.</p><p>“LA Ink” was the show that catapulted Kat Von D’s career to new heights.

Among her favorite musical artists, Kat Von D lists Lemmy Kilmister, The Mars Volta, and Selena.</p><p>Kat Von D is a vegan, and her makeup line is cruelty-free. In 2016, she received Farm Sanctuary’s “Compassion in Action Award” for her work on behalf of animal rights. However, in June 2018, she sparked controversy by indicating on Instagram that she would refuse to vaccinate her future children and raise them on a vegan diet.
