Even though she remains less outspoken about the case than her husband, there are a few things we need to learn about Roberta.</p><p>So, let’s delve into this Roberta Laundrie Bio to learn more about her. Here we cover her age, her job, and other related details to the case.</p><h3><strong>Meet Roberta Laundrie, Brian Laundrie’s Mom</strong></h3><p>The family attorney of Brian Laundrie revealed that Brian died by suicide. His parents, <a href=#>Chris Laundrie</a> and Roberta Laundrie were informed that the cause of his death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide which was released on 23 November 2021. His parents were mourning the loss of Brian’s life. The attorney also revealed that finding him brought closure to his parents.</p><p>In Mid October, FBI Tampa revealed that they have found partial human remains at the Carlton Reserve but were not identified, initially. They also recovered Laundrie’s backpack and notebook. The family attorney revealed Brian’s father found a bag containing some of Brian’s items, and officers found the backpack on the other side of the trail which was near the remains.</p><p>Brian’s skeletal remains were found on 20 October 2021 at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park. Professor of Forensic studies David Thomas, Ph.D. shared that Laundrie’s body likely decomposed quickly due to the heat and humidity in Florida.</p><p>In late October 2021, Roberta made headlines after North Port Police Department revealed that officers mistook Roberta for him the week that he disappeared. A spokesperson for North Port Police Department Josh Taylor said the night that in the early days of the case, as officers surveilled the Laundrie home, they thought they saw Brian Laundrie return in the family Mustang on 15 September.</p><p>But it was his mother Roberta in a baseball cap.</p><p>Laundrie’s family attorney had revealed that Brian left the home of his parents in his silver Ford Mustang on 14 Sept and that Brian’s parents retrieved the Mustang from a parking area at Carlton Reserve on 16 September. The family had remained silent while the investigators searched the 25,000-acre reserve for their son.</p><p>Right after the disappearance of Gabby Petito, Brian’s family avoided co-operating with Gabby’s parents to help find her.</p><h3><strong>Roberta Laundrie Husband</strong></h3><p>Roberta married Christopher “Chris” Laundrie a while back and have been together for at least three decades. Not much information exists on their marriage and relationship.</p><p>In amidst search for Brian, Roberta’s husband had put of no trespassing sign. In mid-October 2021, Chris again emerged from his Florida home Saturday to remove a sign protesters left on his lawn next to a large photo of Gabby Petito, pictures showed. He was also spotted ripping down a yellow sign reading “What if this happened to Cassie?” a reference to his daughter and Brian’s sister.</p><p>In early October, Robert and her husband Chirs agreed that they would leave his North Port house and join the manhunt for his son. Three weeks into the search for their fugitive son, Roberta’s husband started actively helping in the effort to find his son Brian. He went to the nature park for a few hours at the request of investigators according to the Laundrie family attorney, so he could point search crews toward Brian’s favorite spots to hike and camp.</p><p>Besides Brian, Roberta and her husband also have a daughter, an older sister of Brian named Cassie (age 32). Throughout the case, Cassie has been open and has appeared on Good Morning America multiple times in hopes that Brian would have returned home. She appeared for the last time on the 5 October broadcast and urged her brother to come forward.</p><p>On 25 November 2021, news that Chris and Roberta’s “missing gun” from their house didn’t make it to the public.</p><p>Roberta and her husband both surrendered their firearms to law enforcement the same day they informed authorities that their son<strong>&nbsp;</strong>was missing. The comment from the family attorney came days after the forensic report confirmed that it was Laundrie’s remains that they discovered and he died by suicide.</p><p>As reported, Roberta and Chris surrendered their gun on 17 September. They discovered one handgun was not in its case. Attorney revealed that The FBI and North Port, Florida, police were present at the time of the discovery. Because of the “frenzied atmosphere at the time” the authority kept that piece of information a secret from the public.</p><p>Before Chris agreed to help with the search, he and his wife Roberta holed up in their Florida home.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Roberta Laundrie?</strong></h3><p>At the time of her son’s missing, Roberta Laundrie was 55 years.</p><h3><strong>Roberta Laundrie Job And Business</strong></h3><p>Roberta and her husband Chris are business owners. They ran a company called Juicer Service that sells and services commercial juicing equipment. In the company, Roberta served as the vice-president whereas his husband served as the president of the company. Records revealed the company incorporated on 7 June 2017.</p><p>After the discovery of Gabby’s dead body, their family business took great hits on the internet. Internet users ripped apart Juicer Services Inc. on the internet. The company’s reviews on Google and other websites are condemning the Laundrie family for their silence throughout the case’s investigation.</p><p>Besides the family business, from 2011 to 2020, Roberta worked for Suffolk County. As reported she held an official position in the Department of Health – Office of Water Resources.</p><h3><strong>Is Roberta Laundrie On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, like her husband Chris, Roberta Laundrie is also not on Instagram.
