Photo / Getty Images</p><p>It's a celebration of a quite remarkable life, a victory for talent over poverty and abuse.</p><p>The new highly acclaimed West End show Tina: The Musical portrays Tina Turner's famous escape from violent husband Ike and her rise to stardom as a solo performer.</p><p>Yet there is another, more troubling side to her success, according to her adopted son – one that is not portrayed on stage, reports <a href=#>The Daily Mail.</a></p><p>Because Ike Turner Jnr has claimed that his superstar mother has all but abandoned her family in the US.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Tina raised me from the age of two. She's the only mother I've ever known,' the musician told The Mail on Sunday. 'But I haven't talked to my mother since God knows when – probably around 2000. I don't think any of my brothers have talked to her in a long time either.</p><p>"My mother is living her life – she has a new husband and she's in Europe. She doesn't want to have anything to do with the past."</p><p>According to Ike Jnr, Tina, 78, has distanced herself from the part of her life spent with his father and has cut herself off from her children.</p><p>Tina has four children: Craig, now 60, born after she had a fling with a saxophonist as a teenager; Ronnie, 57, her and Ike's only child together; and Ike Jnr, 59, and Michael, 58, born to Ike Snr and his first wife but adopted by Tina when she married the star in 1962.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The turbulent story of Ike and Tina is part of music history. The drug addict son of a Mississippi preacher, Ike regularly beat up Tina until, after 16 years, she fled in the middle of the night in a bloodstained white suit with just 36 cents in her pocket.</p><p>She has lived in Switzerland since 1994 with German music producer Erwin Bach. The couple married five years ago.</p><p>Ike Jnr said: "My brothers are doing OK. They get money from a trust fund.</p><p>"I talk to Ronnie periodically – he's in great health and married to singer Afida Turner. Craig is in real estate. They both live in LA.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>"Michael is in a convalescent home in Southern California and needs medical support. I've been to see him quite a few times. He's doing great." Asked if Tina ever visits Michael, Ike Jnr replied: "No. All she does is send him money.'"</p><p>On the subject of his father's violence – something Ike Snr often denied – Ike Jnr is cagey: "My mother and father had no more fights than the people next door to you. I think their problem was her mouth and his mouth – my father didn't take s*** from nobody."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/7iJLDnG8QTDfwcX1Cpn5QSXxIZ4=/16x21/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/X7RDDLQR7JL4PJXEUUM552FVXQ.jpg"><p>Tina announced to rapturous applause at the new musical's London premiere that she has finally forgiven her ex-husband.</p><p>However, Ike Jnr believes she should have made peace with his father before his death from a cocaine overdose 11 years ago. 'I think it's real late,' said Ike Jnr, adding that he also suffered at the hands of his father, who pistol-whipped him after he began working as Tina's sound engineer.</p><p>But he said he forgave his father while he was still alive – and he wished Tina had done the same.</p><p>Ike and Tina were always absent parents, he claimed.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"We were raised by housekeepers because my mother and father were gone 11 months out of a year.</p><p>"My father took me out of school at 13. I ended up running his recording studio, plus going on the road with them. They made a lot of money on tour and my father used to make me count it until my hands were grey."</p><p>He is worried that the London musical will reinforce the image of his father as a monster rather than a music pioneer – a perception cemented by Tina's autobiography and the 1993 biopic What's Love Got To Do With It. But he confirms the truth about a scene where he turns up at his mother's house covered in blood.</p><p>"When my mother and father separated, he did not want me working with her – and he beat me in the head with a nickel-plated .45 pistol."</p><p>Ike Jnr produced his father's Grammy-winning album Risin' With The Blues in 2006 and now wants to focus on the positive aspects of his parents through his tribute band The Love Thang.</p><p>He said: "All I try to do is do the right thing with the name. I go out there and do my best."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqrrAZquuqp6asW60xKtkm5mToHqwuoyorKtllpa6qrjYZpqlmZmiwG60xKtkmpyfpcGmsIyspqdniIp%2FlI6igIJ%2FjXh9l4uNpY99iGtifqKakKRo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftina-turned-her-back-on-our-family-claims-her-adopted-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftina-turned-her-back-on-our-family-claims-her-adopted-son.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftina-turned-her-back-on-our-family-claims-her-adopted-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftina-turned-her-back-on-our-family-claims-her-adopted-son.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftina-turned-her-back-on-our-family-claims-her-adopted-son.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftina-turned-her-back-on-our-family-claims-her-adopted-son.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./top-10-roger-federer-quotes-of-all-time.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./top-10-roger-federer-quotes-of-all-time.html>Top 10 Roger Federer Quotes of All-Time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./strategic-shift-why-trading-star-elly-de-la-cruz-could-benefit-the-reds.html>Strategic Shift: Why Trading Star Elly De La Cruz Could Benefit the Reds</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./strategic-shift-why-trading-star-elly-de-la-cruz-could-benefit-the-reds.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
