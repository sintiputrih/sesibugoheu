Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Before they made the transition to family and travel vlogging, Darren and Georgie used to put out content related to bodybuilding and a healthy vegan lifestyle. Their family YouTube channel ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Family Fizz</a>‘ has mustered more than 2.47 million subscribers to date.</p><p>Over the years, they have set up several other YouTube ventures, including ‘Vegan Fitness TV’ and ‘Vegan Family TV’.</p><p>They created their main channel on June 24, 2014, under the name VeganFitnessCom. They changed it to Family Fizz before they started vlogging.</p><p>Their first video, titled ‘VEGAN KID’S FIRST BURGER KING’, was posted on December 1, 2016.</p><p>It shows the family getting ready for its relocation from Brighton, the UK to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, a city in the Canary Islands, Spain.</p><p>On April 4, 2017, in a video titled ‘PACKiNG UP TO MOVE COUNTRY.’ In the video, the family announced that they were moving back to Brighton.</p><p>In the ensuing years, they have been to China, Norway, and the US. They presently reside in Dubai, UAE.</p><p>What sets the Fizz family apart from many other family vloggers on YouTube is the versatility of their content.</p><p>As most of the videos are filmed in and around the house of the bloggers, family vlogs can get quite dull and repetitious, Darren and his family, on the other hand, are constantly on the move.</p><p>This has allowed them the chance to film at new locations, meet new people, and try out new things, earning them a substantial viewership in the process.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-46955 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Darren-Fizz-career.jpg alt="Darren Fizz" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-46955 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Darren Fizz on one of the YouTube videos on the family vlogging channel (Source: YouTube)</p><h2><span id=Scandals>Scandals</span></h2><p>Due to their extensive travel, the family leads virtually to a nomadic life. As of 2019, they have not permanently settled down yet.</p><p>This has garnered the Fizz family some criticism. Many of their regular viewers feel that this lifestyle is not healthy for the children, as the constant moving from one place to another has bereft them of the stability of a home.</p><p>Similarly, they have expressed their doubts about their education as well.</p><p>However, Darren Fizz and Georgie homeschool their girls. Also, they are receiving a much better education by actually experiencing the world than they ever could have if they were cooped up in a classroom.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Darren Fizz has a<strong> height</strong> of&nbsp; 5 feet 7 inches and weighs around 70 kg. His eyes are blue and his hairs are blonde.</p><h2><span id=Darren_Fizz_8211_Net_Worth_2023>Darren Fizz – Net Worth 2023</span></h2><p>This professional YouTuber has earned a hefty amount of money throughout his career.
