They have the moves, they have the image, and they definitely know how to act. The father-son team first caught the attention of fans when they starred together in The Pursuit Of Happyness and have continued to hold reigns in the industry, in <a href=#>terms of coolness and style</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While their relationship isn't perfect, and there have been hiccups along the way, Will and Jaden Smith definitely seem to genuinely love and respect each other, and they definitely have many talents and interests which help to cement their bond as father and son.</p><h2 id=open-communication><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Open Communication</span></h2><p>Jaden Smith's health recently appeared to deteriorate before his fans' eyes? He embraced a vegan lifestyle which left him looking particularly drained and visibly weak.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Got Their Start On A Soap Opera</a></span></p><p>His family confronted him on <a href=#>Red Table Talk</a>, his mom's show, and he agreed to change to vegetarianism. His health appears to be much better (if photos are anything to go by), <a href=#>thanks to the confrontation</a>.</p><h2 id=fearless><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Fearless</span></h2><p>Jaden and Will don't always see eye to eye. This, especially when it comes to Jaden's innate bravado.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Hollywood Romances We Forgot Ever Existed</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will has been apprehensive about his son's apparent fearlessness and his willingness to jump into situations on a creative whim. This creativity is possibly something which fans find irresistible, even if it makes Dad a little apprehensive.</p><h2 id=zero-punishment-zone><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Zero Punishment Zone</span></h2><p>Despite putting pressure on their kids, Will and wife Jada <a href=#>didn't believe in punishing</a> their when they raised them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of The Best Celebrity-Themed Weddings</a></span></p><p>Their thinking was that they were creating humans who would learn to take responsibility for their own actions, and learn to take control over their own lives. Has this been beneficial to Jaden and Willow? Time will tell.</p><h2 id=say-what><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Say What?</span></h2><p>How far can the concept of 'honest communication' be taken? Apparently, quite far. Will and Jaden have been heard discussing everything, from meals to bathroom habits on talk shows, including Will's wife's show, Red Table Talk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-circle-of-safety><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Circle of Safety</span></h2><p>Will is so creative, it's no surprise that he and Jada would come up with a concept like '<a href=#>The Circle of Safety'</a>. This inventive communication device was devised to encourage <a href=#>honest communication between himself and his son</a>. When things are told within this circle, Will has to listen without judgment. However, if it is withheld and discovered, Will has confessed there will be hell to pay.</p><h2 id=highly-pressurised-upbringing><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Highly Pressurised Upbringing</span></h2><p>Jaden Smith allegedly confronted his mom and dad on the <a href=#>immense pressure </a>he experienced growing up, in terms of having to perform at a certain high standard to ensure success.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Rich Are The Olsen Twins? 10 Ways They Got Their $500 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He definitely is a talented young man, who entered the world with big shoes to fill, in terms of his father's immense success in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=home-schooled><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Home-Schooled</span></h2><p>Will and Jada Smith have had an immense influence on their children's <a href=#>philosophical outlook on life</a>. This hasn't always been to Jaden Smith's approval. Critics say he eventually moved out of Hollywood to get away from dad and mom. What Will did try to instill in Jaden was confidence in his own intelligence and thought processes, and it would seem that despite differences in outlook, the pair definitely love each other and have mutual respect for each other's talents.</p><h2 id=on-stage-partnerships><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>On Stage Partnerships</span></h2><p>One of the most beautiful things about Will and Jaden's relationship is how they have shared the stage. When Jaden was on stage at Coachella, Will joined on stage and grabbing the microphone from his son, told everyone how much he loves his boy. Their mutual love for the stage has been something which has definitely cemented their relationship and however up and down their relationship might seem, no-one could disagree that they definitely love each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-s-creative-genius><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Will's 'Creative Genius'</span></h2><p>Jaden Smith is indeed talented and Will sees his son as a creative genius. He is intelligent, musical and an ace at acting. However, it would seem another facet of his relationship with father Will, is Will's constant reminders to him that he is a genius, and set apart for great things. Critics have said Will's overzealous praise of his son has created an overconfident young man who believes everyone should step in line with what he determines. However, Will and Jada definitely seem to believe that Jaden is a cut above the rest and perhaps he is. It's hard to argue that his performance in Karate Kid 2 isn't something spectacular, and he definitely has some of that special stardust which makes Will a legend on screen.</p><h2 id=a-mutual-respect><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Mutual Respect</span></h2><p>Despite having some turbulence in their relationship, father and son seem to express mutual respect for each other's careers. This was demonstrated when Jaden played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song at <a href=#>Will's 51st birthday celebration</a>. This was a touching gesture, which Jaden added to by posting about his great and incomprehensible love for his Dad online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Stars We Didn't Realise Were Child Actors</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoqScYreisMSnZKylmam1br7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2arq6Gmnq5w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-jaden-smith-relationship-trivia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwill-jaden-smith-relationship-trivia.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwill-jaden-smith-relationship-trivia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwill-jaden-smith-relationship-trivia.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-jaden-smith-relationship-trivia.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-jaden-smith-relationship-trivia.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html>Bob Saget's Fans Think His Wife Has No Business Putting Herself Back Onto The Dating Market After Hi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paula-fernandess-boyfriend-list.html>Who is Paula Fernandes Dating Paula Fernandes's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paula-fernandess-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
