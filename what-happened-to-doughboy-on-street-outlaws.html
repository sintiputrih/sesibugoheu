He stopped updating his social media.</p><p>Fans want to know: what happened to Doughboy on Street Outlaws? Here’s the answer.</p><h2><strong>Who is Doughboy on Street Outlaws?</strong></h2><p>Doughboy is the son of Street Outlaws Memphis big boss man, Jonathan Day—AKA JJ Da Boss.</p><p>And no, Tricia “Midget” Day is not his mom—JJ’s wife is actually 10 years younger than he is, and was only 7 years old when JJ welcomed his first child with someone else.</p><p>Doughboy was born on December 31, 1990, in his dad’s hometown outside Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>He is the oldest of JJ’s 11 children, and his real name is Joshua Day.</p><p>He married his wife, fellow street racer Chelsea, in September of 2015, and the pair have two children—a son named Kamden and a daughter named Novaleigh.</p><p>Doughboy first appeared on Street Outlaws: Memphis in only its second episode, and he rapidly amassed some die-hard fans.</p><p>In mid-2021, those fans noticed that Doughboy wasn’t on the show anymore.</p><p>Tracking his social media, it appeared that he hadn’t even posted on Instagram since April of 2019.</p><p>While the show must go on, Doughboy didn’t appear in the next 12 episodes until 2022.</p><h2><strong>What happened to Doughboy from Street Outlaws?</strong></h2><p>Doughboy Day’s absence from the hit Discovery show throughout season 5 generated a lot of attention and led to some pretty unhappy viewers.</p><p>The cast, crew, and show producers remained tight-lipped on Doughboy’s whereabouts, leading fans to speculate that something terrible had happened.</p><p>Viewers also drew attention to the fact that in show footage and social media posts by the Street Outlaws: Memphis crew, Doughboy’s wife, Chelsea, and the pair’s two children are often around.</p><p>The trio appear to spend a lot of time at JJ and Tricia’s home—but Doughboy is never in the shots.</p><p>When news surfaced that Chelsea and their children were living with JJ Da Boss and Tricia, fans became even more suspicious.</p><p>Theories were varied—with many fans on Reddit suggesting that Doughboy was possibly in jail following some earlier legal issues. One user set the record straight on that theory, explaining that “<a href=# rel=noopener>you can check the jail records and he’s not in jail</a>.”</p><p>Others thought the legal issues he had previously referred to were following the often circulated Cali fight, in which Doughboy appeared to play a major role. After this, the theory was that Discovery / Pilgrim did not want him on the show.</p><p>Due to contractual obligations, this also meant he could not be shown in any social media channels endorsed by the show—like other cast members’ Instagram feeds, for example.</p><p>As a long-time member of the larger Day family—and Precious Cooper’s sister—Chelsea continues racing and is involved with the rest of the crew.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Albert DePrisco Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Where is Doughboy from Street Outlaws, really?</strong></h2><p>Possibly tiring of all the gossip that detracted from the Street Outlaws: Memphis show—and the racing itself—JJ Da Boss eventually explained in a video excerpt that Doughboy was having back trouble.</p><p>He explained that Doughboy had an injured disk in his back.</p><p>Given that the eldest of the Day children had sustained serious injuries in a car accident back in season 2 of the show, it might make sense that he is currently out of action.</p><p>As if to confirm this, some fans noted that they spotted Doughboy at the end of season 5, episode 7, in the background.</p><p>This has not been confirmed by show execs but it goes a long way to dispelling some of the rumors going around.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is JJ and precious relationship</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is Willy McQuillian’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdp6WctaO72Gamp2Wjqb%2BmsdNmpq6snJbEtHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-doughboy-on-street-outlaws.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-doughboy-on-street-outlaws.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-doughboy-on-street-outlaws.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-doughboy-on-street-outlaws.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-doughboy-on-street-outlaws.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-doughboy-on-street-outlaws.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-jana-kramers-husband-mike-caussin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-jana-kramers-husband-mike-caussin.html>Who is Jana Kramers husband Mike Caussin?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marcella-zoia.html>Marcella Zoia - Age, Net Worth, Height, Bio, Career, Single, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marcella-zoia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
