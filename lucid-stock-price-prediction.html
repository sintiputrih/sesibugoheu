Lucid held a meeting last month for its first model, the Lucid Air.&nbsp;</p><p>The model conveys a sticker price of $169,000. Forthcoming clients were attracted by the guarantees of 470+ miles per charge and a maximum velocity of 168 mph.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the organization expressed that more little expensive models are coming in 2022.</p><p>For the present, LCID stock still has a lot of general interest in its initial periods.&nbsp;</p><p>Clear Motors (LCID) stock has been on the run as of late. The organization declared the conveyances of its presentation Air model before the end of October.&nbsp;</p><p>From that point forward, the stock has acquired an impressive 66 percent to exchange at $44.88. The organization had a few other positive advancements that upheld the stock value rise.&nbsp;</p><p>After its new run, numerous financial investors wonder about Lucid’s stock scale and if it very well may be the following $100 billion organization after Rivian.&nbsp;</p><p>The clear stock has been exchanging by more than 80% since it opened up to the world through an opposite alliance in July.&nbsp;</p><p>It opened up to the world through an opposite merger with Churchill Capital IV (CCIV).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Background History Of Lucid</h2><p>Lucid Group Inc is an American electric vehicle producing organization settled in California.&nbsp;</p><p>It was once known as Atieva. The organization was established in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>It initially centered around assembling electric vehicle batteries and power trains for another vehicle producer.&nbsp;</p><p>Strangely, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson recently worked in Tesla as VP of Engineering. The organization was rebranded to Lucid Motors in October 2016 and formally reported that it will foster an all-electric, elite exhibition waste vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>On September 17, 2018, Lucid Motors reported that they plan to raise financing estimated at more than $1 billion, and they are in talks with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p><p>The experience contributed to the last designing and testing of the Lucid Air model, whose initial set of conveyances started on October 30, 2021. The venture was finished in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lucid’s Investment In The Coming Year&nbsp;</h2><p>On November 15, Lucid reported its outcomes for the second from the last quarter of 2021 and got a deficiency of $524.4 million.&nbsp;</p><p>LCID’s stock cost hopped by more than 5% late at night. The organization declared a significant expansion in vehicle reservations and reaffirmed its creation focus for 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>One more leap forward for the organization came on November 15 when the Lucid Air, the company’s first model, was named MotorTrends 2022 Car of the Year.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s whenever that any automaker first has won this honor for its absolute first vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>On September 17, the EPA formally made the Lucid Air Dream range version the electric car with the most extended battery range.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LCID’s Stock Estimate And Predictions&nbsp;</h2><p>Money Street has been optimistic about the stock. Among the four experts covering the stock, three have a purchase rating, while one has a sell rating, as indicated by Market Beat.&nbsp;</p><p>The agreement target cost for the stock is $28.5, which infers a disadvantage of 36%.&nbsp;</p><p>However, a large part of the drawback is that investigators haven’t found the speed of the stock development over the most recent couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 10, Bank of America multiplied its objective cost for LCID from $30 to $60 and kept a purchase rating.&nbsp;</p><p>Bank of America investigator Joseph Murphy feels that Lucid, alongside Tesla, will probably raise minimal expense capital.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will Lucid Be The Following $100 Billion Organization After Rivian?&nbsp;</h2><p>Rivian opened up to the world on November 10 and took off on its presentation. The stock cost has flooded by 67% since its IPO, and its market cap sits at $110 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>The increasing cost has drawn analysis from many market experts, while others like Chamath Palihapitiya have supported the cost.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people question Rivian’s valuation and its recreation. Financial investors keep thinking about whether Lucid, being in a similar industry, could be the following $100 billion organization after Rivian.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Will LCID Go?&nbsp;</h2><p>Recognizing this, not all examiners are bullish on Lucid Motors. Investor Place helper Alex Sirois thinks the organization has moving purposes, for example, its exchanging debut and the coming Air dispatch.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he cautions that the street ahead is rough for LCID. Moving into September 2021, he says the dangers are self-evident.&nbsp;</p><p>Different destinations are more bullish. Composing for Market Realist, Ruchi Gupta says that a $100 value target is sensible for LCID stock in the following two years as conveyances start.&nbsp;</p><p>Wallet Investor sees the $120 level as reachable in the following five years.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>LUCID Stock Forecast: Performance chart</h4><figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Stock Name</strong></td><td><strong>1 day</strong></td><td><strong>5 day</strong></td><td><strong>1 Month</strong></td><td><strong>1 Year</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href=#>Lucid Inc</a></strong></td><td>-5.35%</td><td>+22.89%</td><td>+107.4%</td><td>+493.5%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Future Outlook For The Lucid Motors Group Inc.</h2><p>Although the company was rebranded in 2016, it is only a few months since this stock has come into the limelight.</p><p>The company growth has been promising on every front, starting from obtaining Environmental Protection Agency ratings to delivering its first sedan,” Lucid Air Model.”</p><p>In 2022, the company plans to mass-produce Lucid Air Touring and Lucid Air Pure, two lower-end models that are meant to be more price-competitive with other luxury cars.</p><p>The company has ticked all the boxes in 2021 and completed 2021 on a high note.
