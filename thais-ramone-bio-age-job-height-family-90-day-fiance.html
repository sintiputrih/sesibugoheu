Premiered on 17 April 2022, the No. 1 unscripted show from TLC introduced seven (mostly) new couples aiming to make it to the altar. Thais Ramone, whom we shall tell you all about in the rest of the writing, appeared on the reality show coupled with 31-year-old <a href=#>Patrick Mendes</a> of Austin. Did Thais ultimately find her happily ever after with a beau from across the border? Find out below.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>90 Day Fiancé: Are Patrick Mendes And Thais Ramone Still Together?</strong></h3><p>So, 90 Day Fiancé introduced Austin native Patrick Mendes and his Brazillian fiancee, Thais Ramone trying their best to make their long-distance relationship work.</p><p>They met when Patrick was traveling to Brazil to reconnect with family. He was required to brush up on his Portuguese, so he turned to a dating app hoping to find a teacher. Thais swiped right, and they went on several dates over the course of several trips to Brazil.</p><p>Patrick later described on the show that it was almost love at first sight for him and that he had not met anyone as beautiful as Thais ever in his life. Thais herself was also quite enamored by her foreigner-friend.</p><p>Taking it a step ahead, Patrick eventually popped the question and asked her to move to Texas with him. Thais did just that and accepted his proposal; that is (of course) without knowing Patrick was still getting over a previous divorce and his not-so-lavish living situation.</p><p>Anyway despite many things rocky, fans should be elated to learn that the couple has managed to make a wonderful life for themselves and are still happily engaged.</p><p>Besides sharing glimpses of each other on their social media, the TLC pair has also confirmed the current status of their relationship in their respective BIO. Also, even if they did not choose to show it on the internet, they should have celebrated their 2nd anniversary on the 29th of December in 2021.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Thais Ramone Age</strong></h3><p>Because Thais Ramone was born in 1996, she should have turned 25 years old in 2021.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Thais Ramone Family</strong></h3><p>Thais Ramone’s full name is Thais Ramone Ferreira. And because there was no information about her family available, let us tell you what is known about Patrick’s folks and her in-laws.</p><p>Patrick’s father’s side of the family is originally from Brazil. Patrick’s brother was also shown by TLC to its viewers.</p><p>Apparently, Patrick lived with his brother, who refused to adjust his habits of for instance drinking at breakfast, when Thais also came to live with Patrick. Soon, Thais seemed visibly annoyed with her to-be brother-in-law’s behavior and often found herself in heated disagreement with him.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Thais Ramone On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Indeed! Thais Ramone could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@tharamoniee</a>&nbsp;where she had 45 posts and 5,703 followers as of 19 April 2022.</p><p>Thais also had accounts on TikTok @thais90dayfiance, PayPal @thaisramone, and YouTube. But she seemed less active on these platforms.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Thais Ramone Job</strong></h3><p>Thais Ramone is a fashion model. There are professional shots of her on social media endorsing certain brands. Then one time, in an Instagram post, she said anyone who knows her knows how much she likes fashion, fashion shows, or the modeling world in general.</p><p>Speaking of how much the TLC paid her, a source told Radar that 90 Day Fiancé pays their cast members $1,000 to $1,500 per episode. But, as for Thais, because she is a foreigner uprooting her life to come to the states on a K-1 visa, he does not make anything at all from appearing on the show. It is to the American fiances of the respective couples, who are paid the said amount.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Thais Ramone Height</strong></h3><p>Beautiful and glamorous Thais Ramone stands below 5′ 9” tall in height. Seemingly a fitness fanatic, she hones a very well-tamed figure. She has long straight black hair that is of course naturally inherited from likely her mother.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>When Is Thais Ramone’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p style=text-align:left>Thais Ramone celebrates his birthday on the 2nd of June.

She seemed to have everything she maybe wanted and expected to be treated the same way after her marriage. However, once she came over to the States on a K-1 visa, she realized that Patrick’s life was sizably different from the one she left behind in Brazil.</p><p>As per LinkedIn, Patrick has been working as a regional sales manager at Vivint Smart Home since April 2013; he also recently (January 2022) joined Picnic as a sales manager on a contract.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmraCRnsBuvsCmpqedXZe2sHnAoJxmop%2BXeqmxyKCfrWWWlrqquNhmcGlllJbGbrLImqWcnV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthais-ramone-bio-age-job-height-family-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthais-ramone-bio-age-job-height-family-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthais-ramone-bio-age-job-height-family-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthais-ramone-bio-age-job-height-family-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthais-ramone-bio-age-job-height-family-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthais-ramone-bio-age-job-height-family-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anna-cockrell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anna-cockrell.html>Anna Cockrell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-are-kiara-barnes-parents-everything-about-the-fantasy-island-actor-2.html>Who Are Kiara Barnes Parents?
