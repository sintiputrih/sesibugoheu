Women on both the No. 1 and No. 2 home shopping channels seem to have gained a lot of weight in the past few months, enough that it had us doing a double-take at what we are seeing on the screen.</p><p><strong>HSN’s Lynn Murphy</strong>, <strong>Chris Scanlon</strong>, <strong>Connie Craig-Carroll</strong>, <strong>Runyan</strong> and <strong>Shannon Smith</strong> are all looking fuller around the face and hips. It’s a sad setback for Smith, who slimmed down last year and looked spectacular.</p><p>Perhaps everyone is doing too much sampling when celebrity chefs <strong>Wolfgang Puck</strong>, <strong>Emeril Lagasse</strong>, and <strong>Todd English</strong> are in the house, cooking up a storm to demonstrate their cookware lines.</p><p>We aren’t the only ones to notice the weight gains. One writer on an <strong>HSN</strong> Forum asked whether Murphy was pregnant because she looks so big. Murphy got married this summer.</p><p>If she is pregnant, we’re not aware that she’s officially announced it yet, or if any of her colleagues are pregnant (Here’s a hot tip: Never ask a woman when she’s due unless you are absolutely sure she is pregnant).</p><p>And on QVC, right now <strong>Jill Bauer</strong>, <strong>Jane Treacy</strong>, and <strong>Jacque Gonzales</strong> sure look a lot wider when they stand up and step away from their tables on-air. It’s said that the TV camera makes you look 15 pounds heavier, but these ladies can’t blame the camera for the girth we are seeing on them now.</p><p>They need to start using their own networks’ products, starting with Spanx for a slimmer appearance immediately and then going on NutriSystem to lose the extra pounds. Maybe everyone should ask <strong>QVC host Patti Reilly</strong> for her diet secrets. The once hefty host is a sliver of her old self, with a teeny wasp-like waist. Patti, you look marvelous.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=suzanne-runyan-education></span><span>Suzanne Runyan Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Runyan was at a young age, she was attracted by the entertainment world and always had a dream to be part of it. She used to use the cord of the vacuum cleaner as her stage mic and used it to entertain her family. No wonder how she polished her skills! The blond beauty doesn’t ace on talents only but, also in regards to her looks.</p><p>She chooses to stay fit and maintains her body figure: be it via a healthy diet or weight loss; she doesn’t even look like that she is a mother of a grown-up. After high school, Runyan attended <strong>Bowling Green State University</strong> in Ohio. There, she graduated with <strong>Bachelors’s in Broadcast Journalism</strong> in Television.</p><p><strong>Bowling Green State University</strong> (BGSU) is a public research university in Bowling Green, Ohio. The 1,338-acre (541.5 ha) main academic and residential campus is 15 miles (24 km) south of Toledo, Ohio. The university has nationally recognized programs and research facilities in the natural and social sciences, education, arts, business, health and wellness, humanities, and applied technologies.</p><p>The institution was granted a charter in 1910 as a normal school, specializing in teacher training and education, as part of the <strong>Lowry Normal School Bill</strong> that authorized two new normal schools in the state of Ohio. Over the university’s history, it developed from a small rural normal school into a comprehensive public university.</p><p>As of 2019, Bowling Green offered over 200 undergraduate programs, as well as master’s and doctoral degrees through eight academic colleges. Its academic programs have been nationally ranked by Forbes magazine, U.S. News & World Report, and Washington Monthly. The University is also ranked the most affordable college in Ohio by Business Insider in 2018.</p><p>Additionally, in 2018 BGSU received designation as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity (IEP) University by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) and its Commission on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Economic Prosperity. The 2011 Carnegie Foundation classified BGSU as having “high research activity”.</p><p>Research projects in the areas of psychology, sociology, education and human development, energy, and sustainability are among the most prominent. BGSU had an on-campus residential student population of approximately 6,000 students and a total enrollment of over 19,000 students as of 2018.</p><p>The university also maintains a satellite campus, known as BGSU Firelands, in Huron, Ohio, 60 miles (97 km) east of the main campus. Although the majority of students attend classes on BGSU’s main campus, about 2,000 students attend classes at Firelands and about 600 additional students attend online. About 85% of Bowling Green’s students are from Ohio.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=suzanne-runyan-family-parents-and-siblings></span><span>Suzanne Runyan Family: Parents and Siblings</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Runyan</strong> was <strong>born and raised</strong>&nbsp;by her&nbsp;<strong>parents</strong> in Delaware, Ohio.
