A <a href=#>physical confrontation</a> ensued between Edwards and <strong>Travis Scott </strong>after the rapper insulted <strong>Tyga</strong>, a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>According to an eyewitness, the incident began when Scott, 33, and Tyga, 34, were on stage at an event hosted by nightclub tycoon <b>Richie Akiva</b>. The onlooker told&nbsp;<i>Us</i> that Akiva gave Tyga a shoutout but Scott “grabbed the mic” out of Akiva’s hand to stop it, which led to Edwards intervening.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“AE started talking back to Travis. There was a big group of all their friends on stage as well. Travis walked off the stage and came back with [music producer] <b>Southside</b>, who started yelling at AE,” the witness claimed. “Travis tried to push AE off the stage and then all three were shoving each other. AE got a hold of Travis and threw him off the stage.”</span></p><p>A second source explained to Us that Edwards tried&nbsp;<span class=s1>to tell Scott that Akiva was “just showing love” to Tyga. While Scott initially stormed off stage, he later returned to confront Edwards with Southside and they became “erratic.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“AE was trying to calm down Southside and he wasn’t calming down and Southside was getting in his face,” the insider claimed. “They got into a shoving match and a fistfight and Travis came to defend his friend Southside and pushed AE. And when he got his bearings he defended himself.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When TMZ asked about the altercation, Edwards replied, “It’s all good,” and added, “I don’t want to fight. I don’t want to initiate that s–t.” At the same time, “I’m gonna protect myself and my people.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for what Cher thought of his involvement, he quoted this line from Future song’s “GTA”: “Whatever I’m with, my b—h with it too.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He then edited his comment by calling Cher “my woman.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Edwards, Cher and their 40-year age gap first <a href=#><span class=s2>made headlines</span></a> in November 2022 when they were spotted holding hands in Los Angeles. Engagement rumors soon swirled around the pair, especially after Cher shared a photo of a diamond ring that Edwards had given her over the holidays.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“THERE R NO WORDS, ALEXANDER, A.E,” the “Believe” singer&nbsp;</span><span class=s1><a href=#><span class=s2>tweeted in December 2022</span></a>, showing off her sparkler. “Woke up a min ago, & 1st thing … B4 I opened my eyes, I thought, ‘I need 2 run to Mom’s & show her my ring. She loves Diamonds.’ Before I realized it, I had a little tear, but I’m sure this is natural. Bet Mom’s ears were burning last nite. We were telling stories about her, WHAT A WOMAN.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Cher, who wished <a href=#><span class=s2>late mother Georgia Holt</span></a> could have seen Edwards’ gift, subsequently revealed that it was not an engagement ring. About five months later, in May 2023, <i>Us</i> confirmed that Cher and Edwards had<a href=#><span class=s2> ended their relationship</span></a> but remained on good terms.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>But last September, the duo were back on, <a href=#><span class=s2>jointly stepping out at Balmain’s Paris Fashion Week</span></a> presentation.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Cher and AE have been back together for a while now and they’re closer than ever,” a source <a href=#><span class=s2>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i></span></a>. “All their friends think they are adorable together and they have amazing chemistry.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since reuniting, Cher and Edwards have</span><span class=s1> <span class=s2>also spent time </span><a href=#>in the studio</a>.“AE and Cher have been working on music together, and AE even helped produce her latest Christmas album,” the insider told <i>Us</i>. “Everybody knows Cher is a music legend, but AE’s been trying to introduce her to a new sound with a little bit of New Age influence.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Cher told <a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s2>Extra</span></a> in October 2023 that Edwards was the individual who encouraged her to make <a href=#><span class=s2>her first holiday album</span></a>, succinctly titled <i>Christmas</i>. “It’s a very strange Christmas album,” she said of the LP. “All the tracks are their own little islands. Nothing seems to go together, but when you hear it, it works.”</span></p><p>While their age difference doesn’t seem to faze them, Cher’s older cultural references tend to fly over Edwards’ head.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Sometimes I’m talking to him and he has no idea who I’m talking about,” <span class=s2>Cher quipped to Extra</span>. “The other day, I said, ‘Do you know who, I don’t know, <strong>Clark Gable</strong> [is]?’ Somebody [else] said, ‘Yes, of course,’ but most of my references … He’ll look at me and go, ‘I wasn’t born yet.’”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJWnwG6uzrKdq6GVo7FurcRmnJ2vkaextHnSmrCsZaSdsrq%2BxGaYZqCRpb26ecWapKKkqWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchers-boyfriend-ae-edwards-says-theyre-a-happy-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchers-boyfriend-ae-edwards-says-theyre-a-happy-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchers-boyfriend-ae-edwards-says-theyre-a-happy-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchers-boyfriend-ae-edwards-says-theyre-a-happy-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchers-boyfriend-ae-edwards-says-theyre-a-happy-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchers-boyfriend-ae-edwards-says-theyre-a-happy-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./claudia-conway.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./claudia-conway.html>Claudia Conway - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bailey-mcknight.html>Bailey McKnight - Age, Net Worth, Height, Bio, Facts, In Relation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bailey-mcknight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
