Both Chelsea and Adam are afraid that they are the cause of Connor’s problems, and they both have assured each other that that is not true.

I find it very hard to believe he wouldn’t be better off with his family, living at home, and seeing a therapist in GC.</p><p>I think that there is a highly qualified therapist in GC who can help Conner. Dr. Alcott is only one opinion and I doubt that she is familiar with therapists in GC.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I think both Chelsea and Adam doing their best to help their son and Chelsea did do her homework and that hospital is the best for Connor. Now maybe they can find a better solution, closer to home, but at least they are working together for their son. Let’s face it, both of them have had their own problems which hasn’t helped Connor. Adam has done plenty of wrong things in his life and when married to Chelsea, he was too busy with Sharon which set Chelsea off. Now they are both haunted by their past when it comes to Connor but are working together to find a solution. I did love Adam with Chelsea, it was so riveting and having felt that way about a couple since then.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Until we find out that Dr. Alcott, a specialist in OCD, is incorrect in her diagnosis of Connor and her prescribed treatment, I will believe that she is correct. Because to me, Dr. Alcott is not the story. The story is in how Connor’s illness affects Chelsea and Adam and the people who are supporting them.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I wonder if, in his spare time, JG writes phone scripts for those scammers who call people to try to get them to send money to an out of town relative, or who tell them that their bank account has been hacked and they need to move all their money out of the account right away, etc. They always are pushing the urgency line telling people that they have to act <strong>right now!!</strong>. It’s all a ploy of course to get them to move money before they have time to really think things out.</p><p>I see the same ploy at work here…it’s the best place, there is only one spot left, you have to act right now!!! Usually when I see someone pushing that ‘urgent’ line it’s a sign that there is a good reason to slow down and think things over.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/starkllr/48/913_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> starkllr:<p>She’s nearly manic in most of these scenes, especially when anyone disagrees with her in the slightest.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/arrow_up.png title=:arrow_up: alt=:arrow_up: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> THIS <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/arrow_up.png title=:arrow_up: alt=:arrow_up: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>She has never been officially diagnosed as bipolar, but she’s definitely bipolar.
