<time>26 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Ben Shapiro, a famous US conservative pundit, has been married for more than a decade to the same woman. His wife is named Mor Shapiro, and even though they share many fundamental values, they are as different as night and day in some areas.</p><p>For instance, while Ben doesn’t mind airing his opinions and appearing on TV, his wife, Mor, tends to shy away from any publicity. Instead, she prefers to work anonymously, saving lives with her medical career. Here is all we know about her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Ben_Shapiro_Married></span>Is Ben Shapiro Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Ben Shapiro is married to the love of his life Mor Shapiro. They have been married since 2008, and at their wedding, Ben was 24 while Mor was 20.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/piroo-788x1024.jpg><p>Their wedding ceremony was held in Acre, Israel, with Ben’s father reading a unique poem for the couple. Their wedding ceremony abided by traditional Jewish rules as the couple is extremely conscious about their faith.&nbsp;</p><p>According to several sources, Mor is a religious woman who never dated a non-Jewish man. Raised a strict orthodox Jew, she grew up with a desire to marry a man of the same faith, and fortunately, she found that in Ben Shapiro. While they lived in Los Angeles, Mor filled in as a Sunday school teacher, teaching Judaica and Hebrew at the University of Synagogue.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Ben_Shapiros_Wife></span>Who Is Ben Shapiro’s Wife?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ben Shapiro’s Wife is <a href=#>Mor Shapiro</a>. She was born Mor Toledaro in 1988 in Herzliya, Israel, to a Jewish Moroccan family. She migrated to Sacramento, California, when she was 12 and has established herself in the US since then.&nbsp;</p><p>Mor is believed to be a doctor who practices family medicine in Woodland Hills, California. She is passionate about her job. However, in the past, she has proven that it comes after her family.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben once revealed: “Early in our marriage, my wife was still in college at UCLA, and I was interested in taking a job in New York; she dutifully offered to transfer to a college across the country.”&nbsp;</p><p>He returned the favor when she applied to a nationwide medical school by offering to move his job.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Ben_Shapiro_Have_a_Partner></span>Does Ben Shapiro Have a Partner?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Ben Shapiro has a longtime partner in Mor Shapiro.&nbsp;</p><p>Their marriage is over a decade old but still going very strong. There are many reasons for this. However, according to Ben, it has much to do with how perfectly they complete each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/morr.jpg><p>Ben once <a href=#>said</a>: “Obviously, chemistry matters; so do shared interests. But these are necessary, not sufficient conditions for marriage. Over time, passionate love shifts into companionate love — you’d better pick the right partner for your life journey, someone who wants the same life you want.”</p><p>Of course, this is not to say that Ben and Mor don’t have their disagreements. Ben has confessed on his show that one thing she does that drives him crazy is how often she loses her phone.&nbsp;Fortunately, it is not a deal breaker for him, and they usually find the phone … eventually.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Was_Mor_Shapiro_Born></span>When Was Mor Shapiro Born?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mor Shapiro was born in 1988 in Israel. She spent her early childhood in the country before moving to the US when she was 12.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ben_Shapiro_and_Mor_Shapiros_Relationship></span>Ben Shapiro and Mor Shapiro’s Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mor Shapiro <a href=#>met</a> her husband while they were attending UCLA. She was introduced to Ben by his sister Abigail aka Classically Abby, a classically trained opera singer and social media influencer.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben Shapiro’s wife dated him for three months before he asked the big question. Despite their brief courtship, she gladly accepted to be his wife, and they have been together ever since. Their marriage has survived a lot since then, including constant backlash from people who do not like his political views.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shapiro.jpg><p>In the past, he was trolled for his statement about the famous Cardi B song “WAP,” among several other reasons. However, his wife does not seem to care. It has not affected their marriage so far, and it’s looking like it never will.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mor_Shapiro_and_Ben_Shapiro_Kids></span>Mor Shapiro and Ben Shapiro Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ben Shapiro’s wife has had three kids for him. Their first child, Leeya Eliana, was born in 2014. Aside from her, the pair also have a son born in 2016 and another daughter born in 2020.</p><p>The couple is very private and has chosen to keep the identities and names of their other two kids a secret. The only reason the name of their first child is known is because she had major health challenges as a baby.</p><p>Fortunately, she survived the ordeal, but it came with her name’s revelation. Other stars who have kept their children’s identities secret include Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik, <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> and Blake Lively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aZnqZdqLWivMirpqxlp56zpnnAZqSonJWnu26wwLJkrK2gmr%2BpsdGoZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-ben-shapiros-wife-a-modern-day-superhero.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-ben-shapiros-wife-a-modern-day-superhero.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-ben-shapiros-wife-a-modern-day-superhero.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-ben-shapiros-wife-a-modern-day-superhero.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-ben-shapiros-wife-a-modern-day-superhero.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-ben-shapiros-wife-a-modern-day-superhero.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./princess-diana-almost-called-off-royal-wedding-8558944.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./princess-diana-almost-called-off-royal-wedding-8558944.html>Princess Diana Almost Called Off Wedding to Prince Charles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kathryn-eickstaedt.html>Kathryn Eickstaedt- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kathryn-eickstaedt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
