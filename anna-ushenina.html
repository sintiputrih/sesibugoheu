Ushenina and her compatriots <a href=#>Natalia Zhukova</a> (also undefeated), <a href=#>Kateryna Lagno</a> and <a href=#>Inna Gaponenko</a> each scored between 70 and 80%, in what was a commanding performance, earning them team gold medals and much adulation in chess circles. In 2008, at the Dresden Olympiad, Ukraine's ladies took home the team silver medals, after failing to oust the powerful Georgian team from the top spot.</p><p>At the national Ukrainian Women's Championship, her progress and achievements have been noteworthy.
