Happy shopping!</p><p>With Black Friday fast approaching and sales looking better than ever, now is the perfect time to stock up on more outerwear for the winter. For shoppers still looking to bulk up their collection of cozy toppers, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shop With Us</a> team spotted a North Face jacket we are obsessed with!</p><p>It’s so tempting to scoop up more than one since the jacket is available at such a marked down price — and in several chic color combos. Since Us readers went wild for the last North Face jacket sale, we know this latest find is too good not to share.</p><p>North Face is one of our go-to brands for outerwear designs that effectively block out the cold while allowing&nbsp;Us to still pull off a beautiful bundled up style moment during the colder months. Now there are so many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">on sale at Macy’s</a>!</p><p>The jacket we have fallen for is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Mossbud Fleece-Lined Reversible Jacket</a>. The design has a mock neck and zippered front detail, but that is not the only thing that makes it such a warm and cozy pick. It is also made with a comfy fleece interior plus special Heatseeker insulation meant to keep the wind chill completely out of the equation. To top it all off, it is a reversible design that gives Us two chic ways to wear it. Both sides have zip or slit pockets for practical storage making it the ultimate utility pick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/north-face-fleece-lined-reversible-jacket-macys-sale.jpeg><p><strong>See it: Snag <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Mossbud Fleece-Lined Reversible Jacket</a> (marked down 25 percent off its original $149, now available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$112</a>) while all sizes and colors are still in stock. Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Nordstrom</a>!</strong></p><p>Sizes range from extra small to extra large and the Mossbud jacket (above) comes in four different color options including Mid Asphalt Gray, Fig/Bittersweet, Urban Navy and Black.</p><p>Check out how the Fig/Bittersweet jacket looks when flipped inside out to display its fuzzy fleece side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/north-face-jacket-fleece-reversible-sale-macys.jpeg><p>We love the chocolate brown paired with burgundy in this design! It would be perfect to wear with a pair of dark blue jeans and matching chocolate brown over-the-knee boots. For snowy or rainy days, we could also slip into a pair of skinny pants and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">waterproof ankle boots</a>.</p><p>For shoppers who love outerwear in neutral colors, the Mid Asphalt Gray design is an equally stylish pick. This color option is dark gray on one side while the fleece side is a few shades lighter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mid-Asphalt-gray-version-north-face-jacket-reversible.jpeg><p>We will be layering this jacket over a white sweater with light gray joggers and fresh white <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> for a stylish look that perfectly plays up neutrals. The jacket would also look great with jeans and a fuzzy pair of Uggs!</p><p>Fashionistas who prefer an outerwear pick in a classic black would love this version of the Mossbud jacket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/black-reversible-jacket-fleece-macys.jpeg><p>We can literally wear this black topper with everything from everyday sweater and jeans combinations to cozy sweater dresses and ankle boots. It also makes for a trusty topper to keep on a coat rack for a last-minute option that makes it easy to run out of the door with confidence knowing it will match whatever we’re wearing.</p><p>Shoppers who love this Mossbud jacket design but would like it in a different color option will love this super trendy metallic version available at Nordstrom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/metallic-mossbud-reversible-heatseeker-jacket.jpeg><p><strong>See it: Snag <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Mossbud Fleece-Lined Reversible Jacket</a> (marked down 25 percent off its original $149, now available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$112</a>) while all sizes and colors are still in stock. Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Nordstrom</a>!</strong></p><p>It flips inside out to display the black fleece side with the metallic copper hue showing up as an accent color in the inner flaps and collar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copper-and-black-fleece-jacket-northface.jpeg><p>Shoppers who bought and wore this coat rave most about how comfortable it is to wear. They also really love how lightweight the jacket is despite its powerful and warm design. Since it’s easy to move around in, we know this jacket will make whatever tasks we have in store for the day much easier to accomplish.</p><p>We especially love being able to basically score two jackets for the price of one thanks to its reversible feature. While it is on sale for such a great price, we can snag a few of these outerwear pieces to give away as <a href=# data-gift=1>gifts</a> for the holidays so our family members, friends and other loved ones are just as prepared for the chilly winter months as we are.</p><p>There are also so many more North Face jackets on sale to choose from like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Tamburello Insulated Ski Jacket</a> created especially for Macy’s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Osito 2 Fleece Jacket</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Crescent Fleece Hooded Wrap</a>.</p><p>Who’s ready to go winter coat shopping with&nbsp;Us? The last time we told you about a North Face jacket sale, they sold out immediately so it is important to grab this deal while it is still hot!</p><p><strong>See it: Snag <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The North Face Mossbud Fleece-Lined Reversible Jacket</a> (marked down 25 percent off its original $149, now available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$112</a>) while all sizes and colors are still in stock.
