He’s in Switzerland, of all places — not where most expectant fathers are when their nine-months-pregnant fiancées are home in Los Angeles, at least one layover away. But, it’s Art Basel, and Kanye has been sufficiently moved to stage an impromptu listening session for his seventh solo album, the then-unreleased <i>Yeezus</i>. So he sends out a few emails and makes it happen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac431c98297f3d069571e9a14a52b39d-3-0-1@published data-word-count=52>Before he hits play on the songs (he does so from his custom matte-black MacBook Pro, no MPC), he ambles through a disjointed, staccato monologue: Steve Jobs, the ugliness of the YouTube player, ad agencies, being a “very commercial celebrity boyfriend.” But mostly, he wants to talk about the act of appropriating.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac431c98297f3d069571e9a14a52b39d-3-0-2@published data-word-count=132>“I wanted to make something of impact,” he says of his earliest experiences in making music. “I found that when I would drop samples [as opposed to original compositions], my friends would react to it more. I felt that I had a real talent in chopping and appropriating music.” He’s self-deprecating when he compares himself to Andy Warhol (“I’m a black guy, so I’m gonna name the most obvious artist in the world”), but he means it. Finally he lets the songs — which take the industrial sides of Chicago drill and acid house and molds them into a midlife crisis — do the talking. Two and a half years later, North West has a younger brother, her parents are married, and <i>Yeezus </i>remains perhaps the most divisive album of the decade.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac431c98297f3d069571e9a14a52b39d-3-0-3@published data-word-count=89>Kanye’s career has always been about appropriation, and the moment when appropriation bleeds into synthesis. His best work takes something recognizable and bends it into his orbit. That can be a near-direct lift (Jay Z’s “Izzo” sees West add drums to a pitched-around version of the Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back”) or more oblique–as in “Runaway,” where he takes the Backyard Heavies drum loop that Pete Rock famously sampled on “The Basement” and wrapped in salmon-colored silk and antipathy. But there’s always value in tracing the source material.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac431c98297f3d069571e9a14a52b39d-3-0-4@published data-word-count=95>As a producer, he’s seen as a visionary. His 2004 debut<i>, The College Dropout</i>, typified the soul-sampling style that made him famous; 2005’s <i>Late Registration </i>incorporated broad, baroque orchestrations; <i>Graduation </i>was the siren call for electronic hip-hop; 2008’s <i>808s & Heartbreak </i>moved entire genres into minor keys and made Drake’s career possible; 2010’s <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy </i>urged rappers to reach for bizarre maximalist heights; 2013’s <i>Yeezus </i>stripped the act back down. His albums have marked sea changes in the genre time and time again, but West makes little effort to obscure his influences.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac431c98297f3d069571e9a14a52b39d-3-0-5@published data-word-count=140>Where Kanye’s appropriation behind the boards is a long and complicated story, his work on the microphone is a little easier to trace. His writing is distinct and often autobiographical, but one of its most enduring (and endearing) hallmarks is his obsession with pop culture. Since he established a national profile as a solo artist, he’s been eager to shoehorn the contents of your grocery store impulse-buy tabloids into his music. Until now, those scattered references and shout-outs have never been collected in one place. So with his seventh solo album, <i>Swish</i>, due February 11, we combed through each of West’s solo albums and one-off singles (plus his half of 2011’s <i>Watch the Throne</i>) to pinpoint every single reference he makes to pop-culture figures and properties, and catalogued them all here.
