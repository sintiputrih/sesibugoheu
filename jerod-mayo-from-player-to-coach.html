During his playing career, Mayo was a standout linebacker, appearing in 103 games and racking up an impressive 905 total tackles. He was named captain for seven consecutive seasons and was a key part of the Patriots' defense during their Super Bowl-winning 2014 season. Mayo's exceptional performance on the field earned him a Pro Bowl selection after the 2012 and 2010 seasons, and he was also named to the 2010 Associated Press All-Pro First Team. Additionally, he led the Patriots in total tackles in each of his first five seasons and won the Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year award, solidifying his impact as a defensive player in the NFL.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Transition to Coaching</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Following his retirement from playing, Jerod Mayo made a seamless transition to coaching.

In his first coaching season, Mayo's tutelage had a significant impact on the team, with linebacker Dont'a Hightower earning his second career Pro Bowl nod. Under Mayo's coaching, the Patriots' defense finished as the number one defense in the NFL in both total defense and scoring, showcasing Mayo's coaching prowess.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Appointment as Head Coach</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In January 2024, Jerod Mayo's coaching journey reached a new milestone when he was appointed as the 15th head coach of the New England Patriots, succeeding the legendary Bill Belichick. Mayo's appointment came after the end of the Belichick era, with Patriots owner Robert Kraft entrusting the reins of the team to the 37-year-old coach. The decision to hire Mayo was widely anticipated, with reports surfacing as early as January 2023 that Mayo was strongly considered to be Belichick's eventual heir. Mayo's hiring was officially announced by the Patriots, and he was scheduled to be introduced as the head coach during a press conference.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Current Role and Responsibilities</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>As the head coach of the New England Patriots, Jerod Mayo is now tasked with leading the team and assembling his coaching staff. One of his first orders of business as head coach is to find assistant coaches for his staff, including interviewing candidates for the defensive coordinator position, such as Carolina Panthers outside linebackers coach Tem Lukabu. Mayo's extensive experience as a player and a coach, coupled with his strong leadership skills, positions him to guide the Patriots and shape the team's future.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jerod Mayo's journey from a standout player to a head coach exemplifies his dedication to the sport of football.
