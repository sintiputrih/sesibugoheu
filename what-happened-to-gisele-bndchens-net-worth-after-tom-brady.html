That — and the kids — was what people were wondering about.

They both have their own separate business entities, so the separation of their wealth wasn’t that complicated in the end. The only other major factor was dividing up their massive property portfolio," a source close to Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady once told Page Six.</p><p>For joint assets, the couple shared a $26 million real estate portfolio, with homes in Miami, Montana, and New York in the United States and one vacation home in Costa Rica. Page Six also reported that Bündchen kept the family's home in Costa Rica. She also kept the NYC apartment, but no word on what happened to their home at the Yellowstone Club in Montana.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-Tom-Brady--Gisele-Bundchen-Parent-Their-Children.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen's Potential Divorce Settlement Might Get Very Messy</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the fact that Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have a prenup in place, there are a lot of unanswered settlement questions.</span><p>Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce settlement was also the easiest, with the couple revising their prenup months before their actual divorce.
