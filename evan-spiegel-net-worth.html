businessman Evan Spiegel’s net worth as of December 2023 is a whopping <strong>$3.2 billion</strong>.</p><p>All of his wealth is a result of Snap Inc., which he co-founded in 2011.</p><p>As mentioned before, he became the youngest billionaire in 2015 at the age of 25.</p><p>In 2013, Evan Spiegel turned down a<strong> $3 billion</strong> cash buyout offer from Facebook.</p><p>You read that right, a 23 years old founder who created an app that made no money at the time and was in its second year of operation just casually turned down a staggering <strong>$3 billion</strong> acquisition offer from the tech giant Facebook.</p><p>He turned down the offer because, in some weird way, he already knew that the app he had created was worth way more than Facebook’s <strong>$3 billion</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/EvanSpiegelAnapchat.jpg><p>Let’s not forget Yahoo offered <strong>$1 billion</strong> to acquire Facebook back in 2006 and see where it is now.</p><p>The history repeated in 2013, and turning down the 10-figure paycheck from Facebook was the best decision Evan ever made.</p><p>The company has an annual revenue of over<strong> $4 billion</strong> and is worth <strong>$36.77 billion</strong> in total.</p><p>Who knew?</p><p>Evan Spiegel, that’s who!</p><p>In August 2014, Venture Capital firm Kleiner Perkins valued the company at <strong>$10 billion.</strong></p><p>The company went public and debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2017.</p><p>While the forecasted per share opening price was <strong>$17</strong>, to everyone’s surprise, it opened at <strong>$24.</strong></p><p>Evan sold <strong>16 million</strong> shares of the company, which garnered him <strong>$272 million</strong> pretax and roughly <strong>$180 million</strong> after-tax.</p><p>As of this writing, Evan still owns roughly <strong>211 million</strong> shares on Snap Inc., and with today’s trading price of <strong>$13.28</strong> per share, that’s more than<strong> $2.8 billion</strong>.</p><p>Again it’s just a rough calculation.</p><h4>Evan Spiegel’s Net Worth Over The Years</h4><table><tbody><tr><td width=312><strong>Year</strong></td><td width=312><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=312><strong>January 2019</strong></td><td width=312>$1.5 Billion</td></tr><tr><td width=312><strong>March 2019</strong></td><td width=312>$2.5 Billion</td></tr><tr><td width=312><strong>June

width=312>$13 Billion</td></tr><tr><td width=312><strong>June 2022</strong></td><td width=312>$3.2 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As we can tell from the above table, Spiegel’s net worth has plummeted significantly since the last year. All this is because of the dip in the market caused by all-time high inflation.</p><p>Did you know that Facebook (now Meta) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who once stood third on the Forbes list of richest people in the world, is not even in the top 10?</p><p>The point I am making with Mark is that inflation has not spared anyone.</p><h3>Salary and Earnings</h3><p>Even though Evan’s salary as the CEO of the company is reportedly<strong> $1</strong>, he receives hundreds of millions of dollars each year through dividends, stock grants, and other compensations.</p><p>In 2017 alone, he received <strong>$638 million</strong> in total compensation majority of which came from a one-time stock award granted to Evan for taking the company public.</p><p>The following year he sold over <strong>$50 million</strong> worth of stock, making his first stock sale since the company’s IPO.</p><p>Similarly, in 2018, he received <strong>$1.18 million</strong> in salary and perks.</p><h2>Net Worth of Evan Spiegel in Different Currencies</h2><p>Evan Spiegel’s net worth as of December 2023 is an enormous <strong>$3.2 billion</strong> and here’s how it looks in other currencies:</p><table width=680><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td>Net Worth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Euro</strong></td><td>€ 3.04 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pound Sterling</strong></td><td>£ 2.59 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Australian Dollar</strong></td><td>A$ 4.53 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canadian Dollar</strong></td><td>C$ 4.08 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indian Rupee</strong></td><td>₹ 250,059,200,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitcoin</strong></td><td>฿ 114,723.87</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Evan Spiegel | Houses & Cars & Jets</h2><h3>Houses</h3><p>Needless to say, billionaire CEO Evan Spiegel lives in an opulent mansion in the poshest neighborhood.</p><p>In 2016, Spiegel paid <strong>$12 million</strong> for a mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles. The house was formerly owned by superstar Hollywood actor<a href=#> Harrison “Han Solo” Ford</a>.</p><p>Evan and Miranda got married one year later at this house.</p><p>Similarly, in 2021 Evan and his wife Miranda paid <strong>$100 million</strong> for a mid-construction property in Holmby Hills, California, over the course of two transactions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/EvanParisHouse.webp><p>The mansion is right across the street from the infamous <a href=#>Playboy mansion</a>.</p><p>Moreover, in 2020 the pair purchased a 10,000 square feet six-bedroom, a five-bathroom mansion near the Seine River, Paris. They reportedly paid <strong>$30 million</strong> for the place.</p><p>Furthermore, they own a vineyard in Miranda’s native Australia and a home in Malibu, California.</p><h3>Cars & Jets</h3><p>The CEO has several high-end cars to roll in style.</p><p>Unlike others’ rags to riches stories, our CEO was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His parents were rich.</p><p>How rich?</p><p>Well, he learned how to drive in a brand new 2006 Cadillac Escalade, which is worth around<strong> $100,000.</strong></p><p>After his parents split, he persuaded his mother to lease him a new BMW 550i, a car with a <strong>$75,000</strong> price tag.</p><p>Similarly, his family had five luxury cars, including a restored 1966 Mustang and three Lexuses.</p><p>Since he is a billionaire himself now, he treats himself with luxurious machines every now and then.</p><p>After he sold<strong> $50 million</strong> worth of stock of Snap, he bought a Ferrari for himself.</p><p>Evan also owns a private jet and has been spotted boarding helicopters on several occasions.</p><p>However, it’s not sure whether he owns the helicopter or just leases them but what is sure is he is a licensed helicopter pilot.</p><h2>Evan Spiegel | Luxurious Lifestyle & Vacations</h2><h3>Luxurious Lifestyle</h3><p>Evan is not shy about living a lavish lifestyle.</p><p>He has several lavish mansions in different parts of the world, several luxurious cars, and every other possible luxury to make life easier and pleasurable.</p><p>He is timid and rarely interacts with employees because he finds it awkward and intimidating.</p><p>During board meetings, he spends much of his time playing with his phone using Snapchat. Duh!!</p><p>Nonetheless, he cares about fashion and perhaps more than most tech CEOs.</p><p>Evan made headlines with his<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Vogue Italy</a> cover in October 2015.</p><p>Savvy!</p><p>For his apparel, he usually attires Common Projects sneakers worth around<strong> $460</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">James Perse</a>‘s white v-neck worth <strong>$60</strong>, and Patrik Ervell’s black jeans worth around<strong> $255</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, Evan holds both American and French citizenship.</p><p>In 2018, he became a citizen of France through a rare and exceptional process.</p><p>As for his personal life, Evan was romantically involved with a model Lucy Aragon in 2013. He was then linked to <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> in 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Miranda-Kerr-Evan-Spiegel-scaled.webp><p>He began dating his now-wife Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr in 2015 after the pair met the year before at dinner for Louis Vuitton.</p><p>The couple is known for their secret lifestyle and maintains a relatively quiet social media presence.</p><p>Evan proposed to Miranda with a <strong>$100,000</strong> ring.</p><p>In 2017, the couple walked down the aisle in a backyard ceremony at their Brentwood home.</p><p>It was a small wedding with no more than 5o attendees. The ceremony included pre-nuptial yoga and after-hours karaoke.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Miranda and Evan honeymooned on the private island of Fiji at a resort owned by Dietrich Mateschitz, Red Bull billionaire.</p><p>Not long after, Evan went on a bro trip sailing off the coast of Italy and Greece. He rented a private yacht which cost him <strong>$1 million</strong> a week.</p><p>Similarly, sometimes he and his father take the helicopter to Canada to go snowboarding.</p><h2>Evan Spiegel | Charity</h2><p>Evan Spiegel has contributed his time and money to several charities at the national as well as international levels.</p><p>In May 2022, during their trip to Australia, the pair donated <strong>$350,000</strong> to Sydney Children’s Hospital Network.</p><p>Similarly, in May 2022, Evan and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Miranda</a> made the donation, which was not revealed but is allegedly over<strong> $10 million</strong>, through the Spiegel Family Fund to clear off the student loans at Otis College of Art’s Graduating Class.</p><p>Evan and Bobby Murphy pledged to donate<strong> 13 million </strong>shares of Class A common stock over the next 20 years to education, arts, and youth non-profits.</p><p>They donated more than <strong>$3 million</strong> to people affected by COVID-19.</p><p>Moreover, Evan also runs Spiegel Family Foundation, which is committed to philanthropy in California and beyond.</p><h2>Evan Spiegel | Career</h2><p>As mentioned before, Evan was born in an affluent household to lawyer parents.</p><p>He grew up in Pacific Palisades, California, which is one of the exclusive neighborhoods in the United States.</p><p>After graduating high school, he enrolled at Stanford University. He met his future business partners Reggie Brown and Bobby Murphy at the university.</p><p>The trio launched the prototype of the app and called it “Picaboo,” which was eventually renamed “Snapchat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SnapChat.jpg><p>By 2012, the app had<strong> 1 million</strong> daily users.</p><p>Due to this success, Evan dropped out of the university to focus fully on his business.</p><p>After six years, he obtained a B.S in product design from Stanford.</p><p>As of December 2023, the CEO of Snap Inc., Evan Spiegel’s net worth, is a staggering <strong>$3.1 billion</strong>.</p><h2>Unknown Facts About Evan Spiegel</h2><ul><li>Reggie Brown, one of the co-founders of Snapchat, filed a lawsuit against Evan.
