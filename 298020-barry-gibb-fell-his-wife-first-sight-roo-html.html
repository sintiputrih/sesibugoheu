The pair live together in a Miami home not far from their kids and grandkids. Theirs is a beautiful life, but had Linda not been involved with Barry, he may have ended up like his brothers.</p><p class=dh>Barry and Linda Gibbs' marriage has endured for more than five decades and is still strong. Barry believes it was love at first sight; perhaps it was.</p><p class=dh>The first time he laid eyes on Linda, Barry had just finished a performance on "Top of the Pops." Linda, then Miss Edinburgh, had been present as a hostess, and while Barry and his band members performed, their eyes met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4ef24bc33574b7acf69e8e497787f752.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>British-Australian bandThe Bee Gees photographed in the late 1960's. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>When he saw her, Barry <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1454&v=VTyiYB8cMMY&feature=youtu.be">said</a> he thought, "That's the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with... I thought it was love at first sight."</p><p class=dh>Linda's friends noticed that Barry was looking at her and let her know, but she denied the thought that someone as gorgeous or famous as him was looking her way. Then Barry started walking towards her, and when he reached her, he asked if she would like to enjoy a cup of tea with him.</p><p class=dh>After the performance on "Top of the Pops," Linda and Barry ran off to another studio and ended up on the set of "Doctor Who," where, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13791205/barry-gibb-sex-doctor-who-tardis/>according</a> to Barry, they "had a bit of a cuddle" in Doctor Who's Tardis while surrounded by Daleks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/27a6da8be977dcdc0984c47053da8a81.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A portrait of The Bee Gees taken in the 1960's. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>At the end of the day, Linda could not resist Barry's attractive looks, and the pair reportedly ended up making out in Doctor Who's phone booth. From then on, they became an item, and their journey to the altar began.</p><p class=dh>When asked what it was about Linda that made him fall for her some years ago, Barry mentioned that it was not really about her looks but more because of her loveliness and sense of humor. The pair dated for some time, then one day, in Adam's Row, Barry went down on his knees and popped the big question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/efebb1dc58e91d7d1ef0059bd621ce91.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Barry Gibb and Linda Gray on their wedding day in 1970. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>They Created a Great Family</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The attraction between Barry and Linda was instant, but the road to the altar was fraught with scandals. Given his status as a pop star, Barry had women flocking around him, ready to do his bidding if he would just give them attention.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>It did not matter how many times she had to dump the pills; Linda refused to let Barry stray down the same path.</strong></h3><p class=dh>In the face of such temptation, Barry floundered. According to Linda, he messed around several times before their marriage, and it was so bad that his mom knew of his reputation. She never thought Barry was going to be serious with Linda and even cautioned her about how he told every woman in his life he would marry them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ebd7a95e6197952f1af90ea9ffc54a5c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Barry Gibb and Linda Gray in London in 1973. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Barry's philandering did not make Linda happy; however, he chose her as the woman he would spend the rest of his life with. Why he did still baffles Linda, but she is glad she was the one he chose.</p><p class=dh>Before she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://bestlifeonline.com/barry-gibb-bee-gees-now-news/>came along,</a> Barry had been married to Maureen Bates. Their relationship lasted from 1966 until 1970. The same year they divorced, Barry married Linda.</p><p class=dh>Barry married her despite what his mom had believed and transformed into what some called the "epitome of a doting husband." Their love story grew from there, and as time passed, they realized that only they could put up with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2bc90352cdf501fa18944152b00dd1e4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Barry Gibb and Linda Gray at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in 2017. | Source: Getty images</p><p class=dh>The pair have remained deeply in love despite all that life has thrown at them, and now they have families that came to be because of their love. The pair welcomed five kidsâ€”Steve, Alexandra, Ashley, Travis, and Michael, and they have become grandparents seven times over.</p><p class=dh>They know the importance of family and have raised a tight one. Indeed, even though most of their kids are grown-ups with kids of their own now, they still live around each other.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Linda Saved His Life</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Barry is known as a successful rock singer these days, and he has sold millions of copies of his music, but not many know that he was only able to get that far with help from his wife, Linda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b8ea6552f92028a21e0527b5c372ae81.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Barry Gibb and Linda Gray attend "Stayin' Alive: A Grammy Salute to the Music of The Bee Gees" on February 14, 2017 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Barry's brothers, Maurice, Andy, and Robin, struggled with their fame; Maurice had a drinking problem that stemmed from his fondness for scotch and Coke. It plagued him for some time until he checked into a rehab in the early 1990s.</p><p class=dh>Robin was addicted to amphetamines, and youngest brother, Andy, who found solo success riding on the wave his brother's fame created, fell victim to cocaine addiction, and it took his life at the age of 30.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5c09bc174e6ed5e64dde02527ac2185e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Barry Gibb with his son Ashley and grandson Lucas in London in 2016. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Barry somehow escaped a similar fate, but what he did differently had more to do with his choice of partners rather than anything else.

Robin passed away from cancer in a shocking death that had Barry questioning why he never revealed his sickness to him. Maurice also died suddenly following a surgery in 2003.</p><p class=dh>One thing the brothers had in common before their demise was resentment for <a class="me a" href=#>Barry</a>, and the star has had to fight off the demons of losing his brothers on bad terms that haunted him.
