He began playing the clarinet at the age of six at Angel Elementary School, under the guidance of his music teacher, Afred T Kirby. Parker continued his education at Cass Tech High School and graduated from Northwestern High School, Detroit in 1971. He then pursued further studies at the Lawrence Institute of Technology.</p><p>Parker’s involvement in music began in the late ’60s, and he co-wrote his first songs with Marvin Gaye at the age of 16. He started his professional career as a studio musician and gained recognition after playing the guitar for Stevie Wonder’s funk song “Maybe Your Baby” in 1972.
