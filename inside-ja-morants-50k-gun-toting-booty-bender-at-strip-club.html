You’d need a rake,” according to one club insider who witnessed the eye-popping hardwood scene.</p><p>The vaunted 23-year-old point guard, who re-signed with the Grizzlies last year in a five-year extension deal that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">could be worth up to $231 million</a>, shelled out at least $50,000 in cash tips in the two-night booty bender, two employees told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ja Morant getting a lap dance in Colorado. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The basketball superstar enjoyed a VIP experience at the jiggle joint.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Grizzlies announced hours after the social media debacle that Morant would miss two games. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><p>“That took forever to count,” a dancer recalled her colleague saying.&nbsp;</p><p>The club insider said Morant arrived at Shotgun Willie’s with a friend and two security guards around 1:30 a.m., just hours after the Grizzlies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mauled the Rockets</a> in Houston, 113-99.</p><p>Eighty minutes after the team’s plane <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">touched down</a> in Denver, the Memphis hotshot slinked in through the back of the club to enter the VIP room, where he sank at least $900 to book the space for three hours, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">per rates on the club’s website</a>, sources said.</p><p>“He was there to party, he wanted some girls in the room,” the insider said. “The music was very, very gangster.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Morant made his first showing at the club just hours after the Grizzlies mauled the Rockets in Houston. <span class=credit>Twitter @ShotgunWillies</span></figure><p>At the club, the Grizzly turned horndog, paying for four dancers and bottle service, and chowing down on a jersey-busting spread of food that appeared to include a basket of hickory-smoked wings, two platters of chicken strips and fries, and a steak, according to the insider and photos.</p><p>“That’s a little excessive, but usually excessiveness is happening all the time,” the insider quipped.</p><p>Two days later, Morant rebounded. After Memphis got trounced 113-97 in Denver, with Morant racking up 23 points, he made a fast break back to Shotgun Willie’s in the wee hours of Saturday, March 4.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">The Instagram misfire was the latest off-court antic plaguing Morant’s meteoric rise in the NBA. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>This time he broadcast himself on Instagram Live as he dangled a gun and belted the lyrics to “Bring ‘Em Out” by the rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again.</p><p>Deborah Dunafon, the majority owner of Shotgun Willie’s, confirmed Morant was a repeat customer on March 2 and 4.</p><p>“This kid, real young, was exceptionally respectful, and sweet and he did not drink [on his second visit],” said Dunafon, 72. “We’ve had [Denver] Nuggets and Broncos … come in and pitch quarters at the girls, be disrespectful and nasty. He’s marvelous.”</p><p>The gun, however, “absolutely terrified” Shotgun girls in the back room, claimed one dancer who wasn’t in the VIP room but heard complaints from her co-workers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Morant spent $50,000 in cash tips in the two-night booty bender. <span class=credit>NBAE via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“He pulled the white boy excuse card: ‘I’m just going through a lot right now, so I’m going to act [like] a fool and put other people’s lives at risk,’” she said.</p><p>Dunafon said she and police reviewed the security footage from Morant’s now-infamous second night, and claimed “nobody saw a gun.”</p><p>And Glendale police said they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">investigated Morant</a> but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">determined</a> that there was not enough evidence to charge him with a crime.</p><p>Yet following the public firestorm over the gun livestream, Morant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apologized</a> to his team and the public for his actions.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ja Morant had livestreamed himself flashing a gun in the club’s VIP room. <span class=credit>Twitter DJ Akademiks @Akademiks</span></figure><p>The Grizzlies announced hours after the social media debacle that Morant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would miss two games</a>, which was later extended to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">include an additional four games</a>. The NBA is investigating Morant and could hit him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a lengthy suspension</a> if it finds he was carrying a firearm on team premises.</p><p>“Our investigation is ongoing,” said NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said Saturday.</p><p>The Instagram misfire is the latest in a string of troubling off-court antics to plague the two-time All-Star’s meteoric rise in the league.&nbsp;</p><p>Days before the gun incident, Morant was the subject of a Washington Post report on two violent incidents he was allegedly involved in last summer.</p><p>A 17-year-old filed a lawsuit against Morant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after he and a friend allegedly</a> pummeled the teen over a dozen times during a pickup game last July before the hotshot went inside and returned with a gun visible in his waistband.</p><p>Morant told a detective that the teen had first chucked a ball at his head, so he was acting in self-defense.</p><p>“I swung first,” Morant told law enforcement, adding, “The ball was to me the first hit.”</p><p>Also in July, Morant was also accused of threatening the head of security at a Memphis mall.</p><p>Morant’s agent, Jim Tanner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> the Washington Post that the allegations were “unsubstantiated rumors and gossip.”</p><p>In February, the NBA <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">investigated allegations</a> by the Indiana Pacers that Morant’s crew “aggressively confronted” members of the team’s traveling party and aimed a red laser at them, which they believed could have been attached to a gun.</p><p>The league could not confirm any evidence that the Morant’s associates had threatened anyone with a weapon. Morant’s best friend, Davonte Pack, who was involved in the conflict, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was banned</a> from the Grizzlies’ FedExForum for the rest of the season.</p><p>Morant’s agent and lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. The Grizzlies did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmamlfnru0tcOeZKOZXaK8s63NrapmbWCgeqjBzWarqKyZo7Rurs6oq7Jlkpq7pbHRZpitZaOpv6q8jJyjrppf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-ja-morants-50k-gun-toting-booty-bender-at-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-ja-morants-50k-gun-toting-booty-bender-at-strip-club.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-ja-morants-50k-gun-toting-booty-bender-at-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-ja-morants-50k-gun-toting-booty-bender-at-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-ja-morants-50k-gun-toting-booty-bender-at-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-ja-morants-50k-gun-toting-booty-bender-at-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./murphy-lee-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./murphy-lee-net-worth-2024.html>Murphy Lee Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-xbox-series-x-review-ushering-in-next-gen.html>Gameplay Analysis: The Wolf Among Us</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-xbox-series-x-review-ushering-in-next-gen.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
