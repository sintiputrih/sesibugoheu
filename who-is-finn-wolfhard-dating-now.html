Fans once thought<a href=#> Finn was dating Jack Dylan Grazer</a>, despite there being no real evidence. Fans also <a href=#>were obsessed with a tattoo Millie Bobby Brown got</a>. There are better examples of this, but generally, it's not a hard thing to see why Finn (and even some of the other actors on the show) keeps his love life private.</p><p>He really has kept it quiet to the point fans have to blackmail him in order to get information on his current relationship with Elsie Pearls.

She's starred in HBO's Doll & Em, a show that was popular back in 2013. Her only other credentials are for a television short called Di Bibl. She does have a lot of clout on social media. She has 150 thousand followers on Instagram, and videos about her on TikTok have racked up nearly 40 million views.</p><p>Elsie's uploaded some pictures of her and Finn to Instagram. She's also prone to posting artsy, experimental pictures most people don't normally post.

Elsie posted a very blurry selfie of her and Finn kissing all the way back in June 2021. There were rumors prior to that they were seeing each other, but nothing was confirmed until that selfie.</p><p>After that, Elsie and Finn were seen with each other at various red-carpet events. Aside from the occasional Instagram picture, Elsie and Finn's relationship really has remained private.</p><h2 id=are-finn-wolfhard-and-elsie-pearls-richter-still-dating><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Are Finn Wolfhard And Elsie Pearls Richter Still Dating</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/elsie-richter-and-finn-wolfhard.jpg><p>It's not known if they're still dating. Most of the time they were seen together in real life or on social media was in 2021. In 2022, rumors started popping up that they weren't dating anymore. The biggest fuel to this rumor fire was that Elsie was not seen at the premiere of Stranger Things season 4. They were spotted at the premiere of HBO's Succession, a show neither of them starred in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were some rumors Elsie was grooming a 14-year-old back in the summer of 2022, but those rumors were proven to be photoshopped. That's the only time the two were mentioned regarding each other in 2022, as many of the rumors were spread around the Stranger Things fanbase.</p><h2 id=why-does-finn-wolfhard-keep-his-dating-life-private><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Does Finn Wolfhard Keep His Dating Life Private?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/finn-wolfhard-red-carpet.jpg><p>A lot of people think Finn and Elsie might be still dating each other, it's just that they've decided to make their relationship private again. It's a bit odd that there's not one picture of Elsie and Finn together in 2022, but there is no confirmation that the two have split. Elsie hasn't been seen with anyone else, and neither has Finn. The theory holds weight since the two were privately in love for a while before their coming out selfie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Elodie Grace Orkin Didn't Like Playing Angela On Stranger Things</a></span></p><p>Why would Finn want to keep his dating life private? The biggest would be that Finn just wants to keep his public life separate from his private life. It's something a lot of celebrities do, and most of the young Stranger Things actors seem to live on that philosophy. There's also the belief that Finn was blackmailed to announce his relationship with Elsie.</p><h2 id=was-finn-wolfhard-really-blackmailed-into-making-his-relationship-public><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Was Finn Wolfhard Really Blackmailed Into Making His Relationship Public?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/eleven-season-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finn confessed in an interview with The Washington Post that he was indeed blackmailed. As a matter of fact, the blurred selfie that Elsie posted was in a reaction to fan's blackmailing them. Finn said that they had Elsie's personal address, and would release it to the public if the two didn't confirm they were dating. <a href=#>Celebrities sometimes get blackmailed</a>, and it just sucks it happened in this case. Perhaps their relationship would have been completely private if not for the blackmail.</p><h2 id=who-else-has-finn-wolfhard-dated><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Who Else Has Finn Wolfhard Dated?</span></h2><p>Finn has never been confirmed to have dated anyone else. As stated earlier, there were popular rumors that Finn was dating Jack Dylan Grazer. Of course there are going to be rumors that Finn was seeing Millie Bobby Brown. Those rumors still linger, despite Millie being engaged and Finn possibly dating Elsie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Stranger Things’ Star Finn Wolfhard Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as Finn's future goes, aside from Stranger Things, he's gotten interested in writing and directing.
