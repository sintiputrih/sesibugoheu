<time>28 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The '70s is widely regarded as the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>greatest decade in American film history</a>—10 years that saw Hollywood shake off the dust of the Production Code and the studio system and chart a bold new course. Directors like <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>, <strong>George Lucas</strong>, and <strong>Francis Ford Coppola</strong>, who'd grown up studying filmmaking, were empowered to create their masterpieces, including mega-hits like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Jaws</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Star Wars</a>, which birthed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>modern blockbuster</a>.</p><p>While you've probably seen the movies that defined the decade, from the mob epic The Godfather&nbsp;to the gritty, Oscar-winning police drama The French Connection to the star-making comedy caper The Sting, the '70s produced countless lesser-known but no less captivating films that are worth tracking down. Here are seven of the best <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>'70s movies</a> you probably haven't seen—and definitely should.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>8 Classic Movies That You Can't Watch Anywhere</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/A-New-Leaf.jpg><p><strong>Walter Matthau</strong> rose to fame opposite <strong>Jack Lemmon</strong> as one half of The Odd Couple in 1968, but a few years after that comedy hit, he took a much darker comedic turn in A New Leaf, from director (and <strong>Mike Nichols</strong> writing partner) <strong>Elaine May</strong>, one of only a handful of women to helm a major studio film during the '70s.</p><p>Matthau plays a broke playboy who aims to find a rich bride, bump her off, and inherit her money, and May herself plays his clueless bride—an eccentric, plant-obsessed heiress in search of a novel variety of fern. Though critically acclaimed, the film flopped at the box office and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>remains largely overlooked today</a>. May went on to make the infamous bomb Ishtar with <strong>Robert Redford</strong> and <strong>Dustin Hoffman</strong>, but that film's critical and commercial drubbing should in no way deter you from seeking out this rare specimen, which is available to rent online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Coffy-e1691079027819.jpg><p>Shaft may be the most famous blaxploitation film of the '70s, but it's missing one element that makes <strong>Jack Hill's</strong> Coffy at least as essential: <strong>Pam Grier</strong> in the leading role. The actor would come to be known as the premiere femme fatale of the era, and—at least according to director <strong>Quentin Tarantino—</strong>the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>first female action hero</a>. It all started with her breakout turn as the titular Coffy, a tough young woman who turns vigilante and hunts down the drug dealer who got her sister addicted to heroin. Tarantino would later credit the film as one of his favorites (and "one of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>coolest movies ever made</a>"), and attempt to rekindle Grier's career by casting her in the 1997 crime thriller Jackie Brown.&nbsp;Coffy&nbsp;is streaming now on Paramount+.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>27 Movies With Shocking Twist Endings You Won't Recover From</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/The-Phantom-of-the-Paradise.jpg><p>Like a punk rock version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, writer/director <strong>Brian De Palma's</strong> The Phantom of the Paradise brings The Phantom of the Opera into the glam rock age. Songwriter Winslow Leach (<strong>William Finly</strong>) is betrayed, beaten, and left for dead by an unscrupulous record producer (<strong>Paul Williams</strong>)&nbsp;who wants to steal his music for the opening of his club, the Paradise of the title. Clad in a mask to cover his mangled face, Leach winds up menacing the music hall and racking up a significant body count as he seeks to turn his muse, singer Phoenix (<strong>Jessica Harper</strong>), into a star in his stead. Though the music earned an Oscar nomination, the contemporary reviews were largely negative and it was a box office failure—yet De Palma's enduring career (he went on to helm the blockbuster <strong>Stephen King</strong> adaptation Carrie in 1976) helped propel it to cult classic status. You can rent it digitally now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Zardoz-e1691079354835.png><p>Two years after exiting the role of James Bond for the second time, <strong>Sean Connery</strong> signed up for the most bizarre project of his storied career: Zardoz, a twisted sci-fi mind trip written and directed by <strong>John Boorman</strong>, who cashed in all the credit he'd earned from turning 1972's Deliverance into a unlikely critical hit and a massive box office success. Unfortunately, the filmmaker's psychedelic passion project—a bizarre future fable in which Connery plays a sort of outlaw (clad in a loincloth and suspenders and little else) navigating a post-apocalyptic world overseen by the cult of a stone god—proved a tough pill to swallow for contemporary audiences. Yet in the decades since, it has attracted <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a cult following of loyalists</a> who swear they find meaning it its pretentious, pontificating script. Whether you're a believer or not, it demands to be seen, if only to witness Her Majesty's greatest super-spy in an orange mankini. You can find it on The Criterion Channel.</p><p><strong>For more movie recommendations sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="no-opener noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Lord-of-the-Rings-1978.jpeg><p><strong>Peter Jackson's</strong> three films based on<strong> J.R.R. Tolkien's</strong> The Lord of the Rings books grossed billions at the box office, but they were a few decades late to the adaptation game. More than 20 years earlier, underground animation icon <strong>Ralph Bakshi</strong>&nbsp;(Fritz the Cat, Wizards) directed his own flawed but ambitious take using both <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>traditional and rotoscoped animation</a>, in which drawings are traced over live-action film. The results are visually surreal, but the film did audiences no additional favors by adapting only half of the trilogy. Though the first film was a financial success, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>planned follow-up never materialized</a>. Still, as a trippy vision of a fantasy classic, it's essential viewing and available for digital rental.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Stay-Hungry.jpg><p>Eight years before The Terminator would turn <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> into an international superstar, the bodybuilder and budding actor landed a key role in this comedic drama directed by <strong>Bob Rafelson</strong> (Five Easy Pieces). The rambling plot of&nbsp;Stay Hungry follows a salesman (<strong>Jeff Bridges</strong>) who buys a bodybuilding gym as part of a shady real estate scheme, woos the gym's receptionist (<strong>Sally Field</strong>), and finds himself drawn to an easygoing, muscular Austrian (Schwarzenegger) training for the Mr. Universe competition. The future action hero earned a Golden Globe for Best Acting Debut for his charismatic supporting turn, and the film itself is just as likable and offbeat. Fortunately, it's streaming for free on Tubi.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger Reveals How Maria Shriver First Confronted Him About His Affair</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Sorcerer.jpg><p><strong>William Friedkin</strong> won an Oscar for directing The French Connection and helmed an indisputable classic of the horror genre in The Exorcist, but his 1977 suspense thriller Sorcerer is every bit the achievement as those two films—though it was poorly reviewed at the time and flopped at the box office. That it was released around the time Star Wars was becoming a cultural phenomenon did the nerve-wracking story of a group of criminals and outcasts hired to drive a load of delicate dynamite across hostile mountain terrain in South America did it no favors. A spiritual cousin to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the 1953 French film The Wages of Fear</a>, this stripped down, adrenaline-fueled character drama has over time become regarded as one of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>unsung masterpieces of the '70s</a>, and it's available as a digital rental.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmm52jqXq2usOeqWasmJp6s63Dmqlmb2Coeq671aKcrGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-under-the-radar-70s-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-under-the-radar-70s-movies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-under-the-radar-70s-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-under-the-radar-70s-movies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-under-the-radar-70s-movies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-under-the-radar-70s-movies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aaryn-smiley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aaryn-smiley.html>Aaryn Smiley - Bio, Career, Single, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fall-candles-pumpkin-apple-cinnamon-harvest-scent-fragrance.html>10 Fall Candles to Make Your Home Smell Fresh and Festive</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fall-candles-pumpkin-apple-cinnamon-harvest-scent-fragrance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
